<a name=s1><h3>What is Lojban?</h3>
<p>
<cx "Lojban, history of">  XE "Lojban: history of"   <cx "Logical Language Group, relation to Lojban">  XE "Logical Language Group: relation to Lojban"   Lojban (pronounced “LOZH-bahn”) is a constructed language. Previous versions of the language were called “Loglan” by Dr. James Cooke Brown, who founded the Loglan Project and started the development of the language in 1955. The goals for the language were first described in the open literature in the article “Loglan”, published in <cite>Scientific American</cite>, June, 1960. Made well-known by that article and by occasional references in science fiction (most notably in Robert Heinlein's novel <cite>The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress) </cite>and computer publications, Loglan and Lojban have been built over four decades by dozens of workers and hundreds of supporters, led since 1987 by The Logical Language Group (who are the publishers of this book).
<p>
<cx "Lojban, features of">  XE "Lojban: features of"   There are thousands of artificial languages (of which Esperanto is the best-known), but Loglan/Lojban has been engineered to make it unique in several ways. The following are the main features of Lojban:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>Lojban is designed to be used by people in communication with each other, and possibly in the future with computers.
<p><dt><dd>Lojban is designed to be neutral between cultures.
<p><dt><dd>Lojban grammar is based on the principles of predicate logic.
<p><dt><dd>Lojban has an unambiguous yet flexible grammar.
<p><dt><dd>Lojban has phonetic spelling, and unambiguously resolves its sounds into words.
<p><dt><dd>Lojban is simple compared to natural languages; it is easy to learn.
<p><dt><dd>Lojban's 1300 root words can be easily combined to form a vocabulary of millions of words.
<p><dt><dd>Lojban is regular; the rules of the language are without exceptions.
<p><dt><dd>Lojban attempts to remove restrictions on creative and clear thought and communication.
<p><dt><dd>Lojban has a variety of uses, ranging from the creative to the scientific, from the theoretical to the practical.
<p><dt><dd>Lojban has been demonstrated in translation and in original works of prose and poetry.

<p>
<cx "reference grammar">  XE "reference grammar"   <cx "this book, goal of">  XE "this book: goal of"   <cx "goal of this book">  XE "goal of this book"   This book is what is called a “reference grammar”. It attempts to expound the whole Lojban language, or at least as much of it as is understood at present. Lojban is a rich language with many features, and an attempt has been made to discover the functions of those features. The word “discover” is used advisedly; Lojban was not “invented” by any one person or committee. Often, grammatical features were introduced into the language long before their usage was fully understood. Sometimes they were introduced for one reason, only to prove more useful for other reasons not recognized at the time.
<p>
By intention, this book is complete in description but not in explanation. For every rule in the formal Lojban grammar (given in <a href=chap21.html>Chapter 21</a>), there is a bit of explanation and an example somewhere in the book, and often a great deal more than a bit. In essence, <a href=chap2.html>Chapter 2 </a>gives a brief overview of the language, <a href=chap21.html>Chapter 21 </a>gives the formal structure of the language, and the chapters in between put semantic bones on that formal flesh. I hope that eventually more grammatical material founded on (or even correcting) the explanations in this book will become available.
<p>
<cx "Lojban, stability of">  XE "Lojban: stability of"   <cx "linguistic drift">  XE "linguistic drift"   Nevertheless, the publication of this book is, in one sense, the completion of a long period of language evolution. With the exception of a possible revision of the language that will not even be considered until five years from publication date, and any revisions of this book needed to correct outright errors, the language described in this book will not be changing by deliberate act of its creators any more. Instead, language change will take place in the form of new vocabulary — Lojban does not yet have nearly the vocabulary it needs to be a fully usable language of the modern world, as <a href=chap12.html>Chapter 12 </a>explains — and through the irregular natural processes of drift and (who knows?) native-speaker evolution. (Teach your children Lojban!) You can learn the language described here with assurance that (unlike previous versions of Lojban and Loglan, as well as most other artificial languages) it will not be subject to further fiddling by language-meisters.
<p>
<cx "structure of this book">  XE "structure of this book"   <cx "this book, structure of">  XE "this book: structure of"   It is probably worth mentioning that this book was written somewhat piecemeal. Each chapter began life as an explication of a specific Lojban topic; only later did these begin to clump together into a larger structure of words and ideas. Therefore, there are perhaps not as many cross-references as there should be. However, I have attempted to make the index as comprehensive as possible.
<p>
<cx "Lojbanistan">  XE "Lojbanistan"   <cx "jokes">  XE "jokes"   <cx "chapter titles, intent of">  XE "chapter titles: intent of"   Each chapter has a descriptive title, often involving some play on words; this is an attempt to make the chapters more memorable. The title of <a href=chap1.html>Chapter 1 </a>(which you are now reading), for example, is an allusion to the book <cite>English As We Speak It In Ireland</cite>, by P. W. Joyce, which is a sort of informal reference grammar of Hiberno-English. “Lojbanistan” is both an imaginary country where Lojban is the native language, and a term for the actual community of Lojban-speakers, scattered over the world. Why “mangle”? As yet, nobody in the real Lojbanistan speaks the language at all well, by the standards of the imaginary Lojbanistan; that is one of the circumstances this book is meant to help remedy.

What are the typographical conventions of this book?</h3>
<p><cx "typographical conventions">  XE "typographical conventions"   <a name=s3><h3>
<cx "sections of this book">  XE "sections of this book"   <cx "this book, sections of">  XE "this book: sections of"   Each chapter is broken into numbered sections; each section contains a mixture of expository text, numbered examples, and possibly tables.
<p>
<cx "examples in this book">  XE "examples in this book"   <cx "this book, examples of">  XE "this book: examples of"   The reader will notice a certain similarity in the examples used throughout the book. One chapter after another rings the changes on the self-same sentences:
<p>
<ex "go to the store">  XE "go to the store: example“  <pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	mi klama le zarci
	I go-to that-which-I-describe-as-a store.
	I go to the store.
</pre>will become wearisomely familiar before <a href=chap21.html>Chapter 21 </a>is reached. This method is deliberate; I have tried to use simple and (eventually) familiar examples wherever possible, to avoid obscuring new grammatical points with new vocabulary. Of course, this is not the method of a textbook, but this book is not a textbook (although people have learned Lojban from it and its predecessors). Rather, it is intended both for self-learning (of course, at present would-be Lojban teachers must be self-learners) and to serve as a reference in the usual sense, for looking up obscure points about the language.
<p>
<cx "example of examples">  XE "example of examples"   <cx "structure of examples">  XE "structure of examples"   <cx "examples, structure of">  XE "examples: structure of"   It is useful to talk further about <a href=#e1d1>Example 1.1 </a>for what it illustrates about examples in this book. Examples usually occupy three lines. The first of these is in Lojban, the second in a word-by-word literal translation of the Lojban into English, and the third in colloquial English. The second and third lines are sometimes called the “literal translation” and the “colloquial translation” respectively. Sometimes, when clarity is not sacrificed thereby, one or both are omitted. If there is more than one Lojban sentence, it generally means that they have the same meaning.
<p>
<cx "square brackets, use of in notation">  XE "square brackets: use of in notation"   Words are sometimes surrounded by square brackets. In Lojban texts, these enclose optional grammatical particles that may (in the context of the particular example) be either omitted or included. In literal translations, they enclose words that are used as conventional translations of specific Lojban words, but don't have exactly the meanings or uses that the English word would suggest. In <a href=chap3.html>Chapter 3</a>, square brackets surround phonetic representations in the International Phonetic Alphabet.
<p>
<cx "tables, format of">  XE "tables: format of"   <cx "grammatical categories, use of upper case for">  XE "grammatical categories: use of upper case for"   Many of the tables, especially those placed at the head of various sections, are in three columns. The first column contains Lojban words discussed in that section; the second column contains the grammatical category (represented by an UPPER CASE Lojban word) to which the word belongs, and the third column contains a brief English gloss, not necessarily or typically a full explanation. Other tables are explained in context.
<p>
<cx "technical terms">  XE "technical terms"   A few Lojban words are used in this book as technical terms. All of these are explained in <a href=chap2.html>Chapter 2</a>, except for a few used only in single chapters, which are explained in the introductory sections of those chapters.
<p>
<a name=s4><h3>Disclaimers</h3>
<p>
<cx "disclaimers">  XE "disclaimers"   It is necessary to add, alas, that the examples used in this book do not refer to any existing person, place, or institution, and that any such resemblance is entirely coincidental and unintentional, and not intended to give offense.
<p>
<cx "dictionary, superior authority of">  XE "dictionary: superior authority of"   When definitions and place structures of gismu, and especially of lujvo, are given in this book, they may differ from those given in the Lojban/English dictionary (which, as of this writing, is not yet published). If so, the information given in the dictionary supersedes whatever is given here.

<cx "Brown, James Cooke">  XE "Brown: James Cooke"   Of course, the entire Loglan Project owes a considerable debt to James Cooke Brown as the language inventor, and also to several earlier contributors to the development of the language. Especially noteworthy are Doug Landauer, Jeff Prothero, Scott Layson, Jeff Taylor, and Bob McIvor. Final responsibility for the remaining errors and infelicities is solely mine.
<p>
<a name=s6><h3>Informal Bibliography</h3>
<p>
<cx "bibliography">  XE "bibliography"   <cx "Loglan">  XE "Loglan"   The founding document for the Loglan Project, of which this book is one of the products, is <cite>Loglan 1: A Logical Language </cite>by James Cooke Brown (4th ed. 1989, The Loglan Institute, Gainesville, Florida, U.S.A.) The language described therein is not Lojban, but is very close to it and may be considered an ancestral version. It is regrettably necessary to state that nothing in this book has been approved by Dr. Brown, and that the very existence of Lojban is disapproved of by him.
<p>
The logic of Lojban, such as it is, owes a good deal to the American philosopher W. v.O. Quine, especially <cite>Word and Object </cite>(1960, M.I.T. Press). Much of Quine's philosophical writings, especially on observation sentences, reads like a literal translation from Lojban.
<p>
The theory of negation expounded in <a href=chap15.html>Chapter 15 </a>is derived from a reading of Larry Horn's work <cite>The Natural History of Negation</cite>.
<p>
Of course, neither Brown nor Quine nor Horn is in any way responsible for the uses or misuses I have made of their works.
<p>
<cx "books about Lojban">  XE "books about Lojban"   Depending on just when you are reading this book, there may be three other books about Lojban available: a textbook, a Lojban/English dictionary, and a book containing general information about Lojban. You can probably get these books, if they have been published, from the same place where you got this book. In addition, other books not yet foreseen may also exist.

<h2>Chapter 2
<br>
A Quick Tour of Lojban Grammar, With Diagrams</h2>
<h6>$Revision: 4.1 $<br>
mkhtml: 1.1</h6></p></center>
<p>
<a name=s1><h3>The concept of the bridi</h3>
<p>
<cx "bridi, concept of">  XE "bridi: concept of"   This chapter gives diagrammed examples of basic Lojban sentence structures. The most general pattern is covered first, followed by successive variations on the basic components of the Lojban sentence. There are many more capabilities not covered in this chapter, but covered in detail in later chapters, so this chapter is a “quick tour” of the material later covered more slowly throughout the book. It also introduces most of the Lojban words used to discuss Lojban grammar.
<p>
<ex "John and Sam">  XE "John and Sam: example“  <ex "father">  XE "father: example“  <ex "hits">  XE "hits: example“  <ex "taller">  XE "taller: example“  Let us consider John and Sam and three statements about them:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	John is the father of Sam.
<a name=e1d2>1.2)	John hits Sam.
<a name=e1d3>1.3)	John is taller than Sam.
</pre><cx "relationship, active/static/attributive compared">  XE "relationship: active/static/attributive compared"   <cx "predication, as a relationship">  XE "predication: as a relationship"   <cx "bridi, compared with predication">  XE "bridi: compared with predication"   <cx "predication, compared with bridi">  XE "predication: compared with bridi"   <cx "brivla, relation to bridi">  XE "brivla: relation to bridi"   <cx "sumti, relation with bridi">  XE "sumti: relation with bridi"   These examples all describe relationships between John and Sam. However, in English, we use the noun “father” to describe a static relationship in <a href=#e1d1>Example 1.1</a>, the verb “hits” to describe an active relationship in <a href=#e1d2>Example 1.2</a>, and the adjective “taller” to describe an attributive relationship in <a href=#e1d3>Example 1.3</a>. In Lojban we make no such grammatical distinctions; these three sentences, when expressed in Lojban, are structurally identical. The same part of speech is used to represent the relationship. In formal logic this whole structure is called a “predication”; in Lojban it is called a “bridi”, and the central part of speech is the “selbri”. Logicians refer to the things thus related as “arguments”, while Lojbanists call them “sumti”. These Lojban terms will be used for the rest of the book.
<p>
bridi (predicate)
|




John
is the father of
Sam



|
sumti
|
selbri
|
sumti (argument)
</pre><ex "give">  XE "give: example“  In a relationship, there are a definite number of things being related. In English, for example, “give” has three places: the donor, the recipient and the gift. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d4>1.4)	John gives Sam the book.
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d5>1.5)	Sam gives John the book.
</pre>mean two different things because the relative positions of “John” and “Sam” have been switched.  <p>
Further,
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d6>1.6)	The book gives John Sam.
</pre>seems strange to us merely because the places are being filled by unorthodox arguments. The relationship expressed by “give” has not changed.
<p>
<cx "place structure, definition of">  XE "place structure: definition"   In Lojban, each selbri has a specified number and type of arguments, known collectively as its “place structure”. The simplest kind of selbri consists of a single root word, called a “gismu”, and the definition in a dictionary gives the place structure explicitly. The primary task of constructing a Lojban sentence, after choosing the relationship itself, is deciding what you will use to fill in the sumti places.
<p>
This book uses the Lojban terms “bridi”, “sumti”, and “selbri”, because it is best to come to understand them independently of the English associations of the corresponding words, which are only roughly similar in meaning anyhow.
<p>
<ex "underlines">  XE "underlines: example“  <cx "notation conventions, for Quick Tour chapter">  XE "notation conventions: for Quick Tour chapter"   <cx "      notation convention for Quick Tour chapter">  XE  selma’o"underscore notation for Quick Tour chapter"  cx "= notation convention for Quick Tour chapter">  XE  selma’o"double underscore notation convention for Quick Tour chapter"  The Lojban examples in this chapter (but not in the rest of the book) use a single underline (     ) under each sumti, and a double underline (     ) under each selbri, to help you to tell them apart.
<p>
<a name=s2><h3>Pronunciation</h3>
<p>
<cx "pronunciation (quick-tour version)">  XE "pronunciation: quick-tour version"   Detailed pronunciation and spelling rules are given in <a href=chap3.html>Chapter 3</a>, but what follows will keep the reader from going too far astray while digesting this chapter.
<p>
<cx "vowels, pronunciation of (quick-tour version)">  XE "vowels: pronunciation of, quick-tour version"   Lojban has six recognized vowels: “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, “u” and “y”. The first five are roughly pronounced as “a” as in “father”, “e” as in “let”, “i” as in “machine”, “o” as in “dome” and “u” as in “flute”. “y” is pronounced as the sound called “schwa”, that is, as the unstressed “a” as in “about” or “around”.
<p>
<cx "consonants, pronunciation of (quick-tour version)">  XE "consonants: pronunciation of, quick-tour version"   Twelve consonants in Lojban are pronounced more or less as their counterparts are in English: “b”, “d”, “f”, “k”, “l”, “m”, “n”, “p”, “r”, “t”, “v” and “z”. The letter “c”, on the other hand is pronounced as the “sh” in “hush”, while “j” is its voiced counterpart, the sound of the “s” in “pleasure”. “g” is always pronounced as it is in “gift”, never as in “giant”. “s” is as in “sell”, never as in “rose”. The sound of “x” is not found in English in normal words. It is found as “ch” in Scottish “loch”, as “j” in Spanish “junta”, and as “ch” in German “Bach”; it also appears in the English interjection “yecchh!”. It gets easier to say as you practice it. The letter “r” can be trilled, but doesn't have to be.
<p>
<cx "diphthongs, pronunciation of (quick-tour version)">  XE "diphthongs: pronunciation of, quick-tour version"   The Lojban diphthongs “ai”, “ei”, “oi”, and “au” are pronounced much as in the English words “sigh”, “say”, “boy”, and “how”. Other Lojban diphthongs begin with an “i” pronounced like English “y” (for example, “io” is pronounced “yo”) or else with a “u” pronounced like English “w” (for example, “ua” is pronounced “wa”).
<p>
<cx "apostrophe (quick-tour version)">  XE "apostrophe: quick-tour version"   <cx "comma (quick-tour version)">  XE "comma: quick-tour version"   <cx "period (quick-tour version)">  XE "period: quick-tour version"   Lojban also has three “semi-letters”: the period, the comma and the apostrophe. The period represents a glottal stop or a pause; it is a required stoppage of the flow of air in the speech stream. The apostrophe sounds just like the English letter “h”. Unlike a regular consonant, it is not found at the beginning or end of a word, nor is it found adjacent to a consonant; it is only found between two vowels. The comma has no sound associated with it, and is used to separate syllables that might ordinarily run together. It is not used in this chapter.
<p>
<cx "stress (quick-tour version)">  XE "stress: quick-tour version"   Stress falls on the next to the last syllable of all words, unless that vowel is “y”, which is never stressed; in such words the third-to-last syllable is stressed. If a word only has one syllable, then that syllable is not stressed.
<p>
All Lojban words are pronounced as they are spelled: there are no silent letters.

<p>
<a name=s3><h3>Words that can act as sumti</h3>
<p>
<cx "pro-sumti (quick-tour version)">  XE "pro-sumti: quick-tour version"   Here is a short table of single words used as sumti. This table provides examples only, not the entire set of such words, which may be found in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7 </a>.
<p>
<pre>mi	I/me, we/us
do	you
ti	this, these
ta	that, those
tu	that far away, those far away
zo'e	unspecified value (used when a sumti is unimportant or obvious)
</pre><p>Lojban sumti are not specific as to number (singular or plural), nor gender (masculine/feminine/neutral). Such distinctions can be optionally added by methods that are beyond the scope of this chapter.
<p>
<cx "pointing cmavo (quick-tour version)">  XE "pointing cmavo: quick-tour version"   The cmavo “ti”, “ta”, and “tu” refer to whatever the speaker is pointing at, and should not be used to refer to things that cannot in principle be pointed at.
<p>
<cx "names (quick-tour version)">  XE "names: quick-tour version"   Names may also be used as sumti, provided they are preceded with the word “la”:
<p>
<pre>la meris.	the one/ones named Mary
la djan.	the one/ones named John
</pre><p>Other Lojban spelling versions are possible for names from other languages, and there are restrictions on which letters may appear in Lojban names: see <a href=chap6.html>Chapter 6 </a>for more information.

<a name=s4><h3>Some words used to indicate selbri relations</h3>
<p>
<cx "selbri list for quick tour">  XE "selbri list for quick tour"   Here is a short table of some words used as Lojban selbri in this chapter:
<p>
<pre>vecnu	x1 (seller) sells x2 (goods) to x3 (buyer) for x4 (price)
tavla	x1 (talker) talks to x2 (audience) about x3 (topic) in language x4
sutra	x1 (agent) is fast at doing x2 (action)
blari'o	x1 (object/light source) is blue-green
melbi	x1 (object/idea) is beautiful to x2 (observer) by standard x3
cutci	x1 is a shoe/boot for x2 (foot) made of x3 (material)
bajra	x1 runs on x2 (surface) using x3 (limbs) in manner x4 (gait)
klama	x1 goes/comes to x2 (destination) from x3 (origin point) via x4 (route) using x5 (means of transportation)
pluka	x1 pleases/is pleasing to x2 (experiencer) under conditions x3
gerku	x1 is a dog of breed x2
kurji	x1 takes care of x2
kanro	x1 is healthy by standard x2
stali	x1 stays/remains with x2
zarci	x1 is a market/store/shop selling x2 (products) operated by x3 (storekeeper)
</pre><cx "x1, notation convention (quick-tour version)">  XE "x1: notation convention, quick-tour version"   Each selbri (relation) has a specific rule that defines the role of each sumti in the bridi, based on its position. In the table above, that order was expressed by labeling the sumti positions as x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5.
<p>
<cx "words not in the dictionary">  XE "words not in the dictionary"   Like the table in <a href=#s3>Section 3</a>, this table is far from complete: in fact, no complete table can exist, because Lojban allows new words to be created (in specified ways) whenever a speaker or writer finds the existing supply of words inadequate. This notion is a basic difference between Lojban (and some other languages such as German and Chinese) and English; in English, most people are very leery of using words that “aren't in the dictionary”. Lojbanists are encouraged to invent new words; doing so is a major way of participating in the development of the language. <a href=chap4.html>Chapter 4 </a>explains how to make new words, and <a href=chap12.html>Chapter 12 </a>explains how to give them appropriate meanings.
<p>
<a name=s5><h3>Some simple Lojban bridi</h3>
<p>
<cx "bridi (quick-tour version)">  XE "bridi: quick-tour version"   Let's look at a simple Lojban bridi. The place structure of the gismu “tavla” is
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	x1 talks to x2 about x3 in language x4
</pre>where the “x”es with following numbers represent the various arguments that could be inserted at the given positions in the English sentence. For example:
<p>
<ex "engineering">  XE "engineering: example“  <pre><a name=e5d2>5.2)	John talks to Sam about engineering in Lojban.
</pre>has “John” in the x1 place, “Sam” in the x2 place, “engineering” in the x3 place, and “Lojban” in the x4 place, and could be paraphrased:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d3>5.3)	Talking is going on,
		with speaker John
		and listener Sam
		and subject matter engineering
		and language Lojban.
</pre><p>The Lojban bridi corresponding to <a href=#e5d1>Example 5.1 </a>will have the form
<p>
<lx "tavla">  XE "tavla"   <pre><a name=e5d4>5.4)	x1 [cu] tavla x2 x3 x4
</pre><cx "cu, omission of (quick-tour version)">  XE "cu: omission of, quick-tour version"   <cx "cu, use of (quick-tour version)">  XE "cu: use of, quick-tour version"   <lx "cu (quick-tour version)">  XE "cu: quick-tour version"   The word “cu” serves as a separator between any preceding sumti and the selbri. It can often be omitted, as in the following examples.
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d5>5.5)	mi tavla do zo'e zo'e
	I talk to you about something in some language.
<a name=e5d6>5.6)	do tavla mi ta zo'e
	You talk to me about that thing in a language.
<a name=e5d7>5.7)	mi tavla zo'e tu ti
	I talk to someone about that thing yonder in this language.
</pre>(<a href=#e5d7>Example 5.7 </a>is a bit unusual, as there is no easy way to point to a language; one might point to a copy of this book, and hope the meaning gets across!)
<p>
<cx "ellipsis (quick-tour version)">  XE "ellipsis: quick-tour version"   <lx "zo'e (quick-tour version)">  XE "zo'e: quick-tour version"   When there are one or more occurrences of the cmavo “zo'e” at the end of a bridi, they may be omitted, a process called “ellipsis”. <a href=#e5d5>Example 5.5 </a>and <a href=#e5d6>Example 5.6 </a>may be expressed thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d8>5.8)	mi tavla do
	I talk to you (about something in some language).
<a name=e5d9>5.9)	do tavla mi ta
	You talk to me about that thing (in some language).
</pre><p>Note that <a href=#e5d7>Example 5.7 </a>is not subject to ellipsis by this direct method, as the “zo'e” in it is not at the end of the bridi.
<p>
<a name=s6><h3>Variant bridi structure</h3>
<p>
<cx "sumti placement, variant (quick-tour version)">  XE "sumti placement: variant, quick-tour version"   Consider the sentence
<p>
6.1)	mi	[cu]	vecnu	ti	ta	zo’e
	seller-x1
sells	goods-sold-x2	buyer-x3	price-x4
	I
sell	this	to that	for some price.
	I sell this-thing/these-things to that-buyer/those-buyers.
(The price is obvious or unimportant.)
</pre><a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1 </a>has one sumti (the x1) before the selbri. It is also possible to put more than one sumti before the selbri, without changing the order of sumti:
6.2)	mi	ti	[cu]	vecnu	ta
	seller-x1	goods-sold-x2
sells	buyer-x3
	I	this
sell	to that.
	(translates as stilted or poetic English)
I this thing do sell to that buyer.
6.3)	mi	ti	ta	[cu]	vecnu

seller-x1	goods-sold-x2	buyer-x3
sells

I	this	to that
sell.

(translates as stilted or poetic English)
I this thing to that buyer do sell.
<p>
</pre><a href=#e6d{1}>Examples 6.1 </a>through <a href=#e6d3>6.3 </a>mean the same thing. Usually, placing more than one sumti before the selbri is done for style or for emphasis on the sumti that are out-of-place from their normal position. (Native speakers of languages other than English may prefer such orders.)
<p>
<cx "observatives (quick-tour version)">  XE "observatives: quick-tour version"   If there are no sumti before the selbri, then it is understood that the x1 sumti value is equivalent to “zo'e”; i.e. unimportant or obvious, and therefore not given. Any sumti after the selbri start counting from x2.
6.4)	ta	[cu]	melbi
	object/idea-x1
is-beautiful (to someone by some standard)
	That/Those
is/are beautiful.
	That is beautiful.

	Those are beautiful.

<p>
</pre>when the x1 is omitted, becomes:
6.5)	 _                _	[cu]	melbi
	unspecified-x1
is-beautiful (to someone by some standard)
	Beautiful!

	It’s beautiful!

<p>
</pre><p>Omitting the x1 adds emphasis to the selbri relation, which has become first in the sentence. This kind of sentence is termed an observative, because it is often used when someone first observes or takes note of the relationship, and wishes to quickly communicate it to someone else. Commonly understood English observatives include “Smoke!” upon seeing smoke or smelling the odor, or “Car!” to a person crossing the street who might be in danger. Any Lojban selbri can be used as an observative if no sumti appear before the selbri.
<p>
The word “cu” does not occur in an observative; “cu” is a separator, and there must be a sumti before the selbri that needs to be kept separate for “cu” to be used. With no sumti preceding the selbri, “cu” is not permitted. Short words like “cu” which serve grammatical functions are called “cmavo” in Lojban.
<p>
<a name=s7><h3>Varying the order of sumti</h3>
<p>
<cx "sumti reordering (quick-tour version)">  XE "sumti reordering: quick-tour version"   <lx "se (quick-tour version)">  XE "se: quick-tour version"   <lx "SE (quick-tour version)">  XE "SE selma’o: quick-tour version"   For one reason or another you may want to change the order, placing one particular sumti at the front of the bridi. The cmavo “se”, when placed before the last word of the selbri, will switch the meanings of the first and second sumti places.  So
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	mi tavla do ti
	I talk to you about this.
</pre>has the same meaning as
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d2>7.2)	do se tavla mi ti
	You are talked to by me about this.
</pre><p><lx "te (quick-tour version)">  XE "te: quick-tour version"   The cmavo “te”, when used in the same location, switches the meanings of the first and the third sumti places.
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d3>7.3)	mi tavla do ti
	I talk to you about this.
</pre>has the same meaning as
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d4>7.4)	ti te tavla do mi
	This is talked about to you by me.
</pre><p>Note that only the first and third sumti have switched places; the second sumti has remained in the second place.
<p>
<lx "ve (quick-tour version)">  XE "ve: quick-tour version"   <lx "xe (quick-tour version)">  XE "xe: quick-tour version"   The cmavo “ve” and “xe” switch the first and fourth sumti places, and the first and fifth sumti places, respectively. These changes in the order of places are known as “conversions”, and the “se”, “te”, “ve”, and “xe” cmavo are said to convert the selbri.
<p>
More than one of these operators may be used on a given selbri at one time, and in such a case they are evaluated from left to right. However, in practice they are used one at a time, as there are better tools for complex manipulation of the sumti places. See <a href=chap5.html>Chapter 5 </a>for details.
<p>
<cx "passive voice">  XE "passive voice"   The effect is similar to what in English is called the “passive voice”. In Lojban, the converted selbri has a new place structure that is renumbered to reflect the place reversal, thus having effects when such a conversion is used in combination with other constructs such as “le selbri [ku]” (see <a href=#s10>Section 10</a>).
<p>
<a name=s8><h3>The basic structure of longer utterances</h3>
<p>
<lx ".i (quick-tour version)">  XE "i: quick-tour version"   <lx "I (quick-tour version)">  XE "I: quick-tour version"   <lx "ni'o (quick-tour version)">  XE "ni'o: quick-tour version"   <lx "NIhO (quick-tour version)">  XE "NIhO selma’o: quick-tour version"   People don't always say just one sentence. Lojban has a specific structure for talk or writing that is longer than one sentence. The entirety of a given speech event or written text is called an utterance. The sentences (usually, but not always, bridi) in an utterance are separated by the cmavo “ni'o” and “.i”. These correspond to a brief pause (or nothing at all) in spoken English, and the various punctuation marks like period, question mark, and exclamation mark in written English. These separators prevent the sumti at the beginning of the next sentence from being mistaken for a trailing sumti of the previous sentence.
<p>
The cmavo “ni'o” separates paragraphs (covering different topics of discussion). In a long text or utterance, the topical structure of the text may be indicated by multiple “ni'o”s, with perhaps “ni'oni'oni'o” used to indicate a chapter, “ni'oni'o” to indicate a section, and a single “ni'o” to indicate a subtopic corresponding to a single English paragraph.
<p>
The cmavo “.i” separates sentences. It is sometimes compounded with words that modify the exact meaning (the semantics) of the sentence in the context of the utterance. (The cmavo “xu”, discussed in <a href=#s1>Section 1</a>.7, is one such word — it turns the sentence from a statement to a question about truth.) When more than one person is talking, a new speaker will usually omit the “.i” even though she/he may be continuing on the same topic.
<p>
It is still O.K. for a new speaker to say the “.i” before continuing; indeed, it is encouraged for maximum clarity (since it is possible that the second speaker might merely be adding words onto the end of the first speaker's sentence). A good translation for “.i” is the “and” used in run-on sentences when people are talking informally: “I did this, and then I did that, and <dots>…</dots>, and <dots>…</dots>”.
<p>
<a name=s9><h3>tanru</h3>
<p>
<cx "tanru (quick-tour version)">  XE "tanru: quick-tour version"   When two gismu are adjacent, the first one modifies the second, and the selbri takes its place structure from the rightmost word. Such combinations of gismu are called “tanru”. For example,
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	sutra tavla
</pre>has the place structure
<p>
<ex "fast talker">  XE "fast talker: example“  <pre><a name=e9d2>9.2)	x1 is a fast type-of talker to x2 about x3 in language x4
	x1 talks fast to x2 about x3 in language x4
</pre><cx "tanru default grouping (quick-tour version)">  XE "tanru default grouping: quick-tour version"   When three or more gismu are in a row, the first modifies the second, and that combined meaning modifies the third, and that combined meaning modifies the fourth, and so on. For example
<p>
<ex "fast-talker shoe">  XE "fast-talker shoe: example“  <pre><a name=e9d3>9.3)	sutra tavla cutci
</pre>has the place structure
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d4>9.4)	s1 is a fast-talker type of shoe worn by s2 of material s3
</pre><p>That is, it is a shoe that is worn by a fast talker rather than a shoe that is fast and is also worn by a talker.
<p>
Note especially the use of “type-of” as a mechanism for connecting the English translations of the two or more gismu; this convention helps the learner understand each tanru in its context. Creative interpretations are also possible, however:
<p>
<ex "runner shoe">  XE "runner shoe: example“  <pre><a name=e9d5>9.5)	bajra cutci
	runner shoe
</pre>most probably refers to shoes suitable for runners, but might be interpreted in some imaginative instances as “shoes that run (by themselves?)”. In general, however, the meaning of a tanru is determined by the literal meaning of its components, and not by any connotations or figurative meanings. Thus
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d6>9.6)	sutra tavla
	fast-talker
</pre>would not necessarily imply any trickery or deception, unlike the English idiom, and a
<p>
<ex "social butterfly">  XE "social butterfly: example“  <ex "butterfly, social">  XE "butterfly: social, example“  <pre><a name=e9d7>9.7)	jikca toldi
	social butterfly
</pre><ex "Lepidoptera">  XE "Lepidoptera: example“  must always be an insect with large brightly-colored wings, of the family <i>Lepidoptera</i>.
<p>
<cx "tanru, place structure of (quick-tour version)">  XE "tanru: place structure of, quick-tour version"   The place structure of a tanru is always that of the final component of the tanru. Thus, the following has the place structure of “klama”:
9.8)	mi	[cu]	sutra klama	la meris.
	I
quickly-go	to Mary.
<p>
</pre><cx "tanru conversion, effect on place structure (quick-tour version)">  XE "tanru conversion: effect on place structure, quick-tour version"   With the conversion “se klama” as the final component of the tanru, the place structure of the entire selbri is that of “se klama”: the x1 place is the destination, and the x2 place is the one who goes:
9.9)	mi	[cu]	sutra se klama	la meris.
	I
quickly am-gone-to	by Mary.
<p>
</pre><cx "tanru, and conversion (quick-tour version)">  XE "tanru: and conversion, quick-tour version"   The following example shows that there is more to conversion than merely switching places, though:
9.10)	la tam.	[cu]	melbi tavla	la meris.
	Tom
beautifully-talks	to Mary.
	Tom is a beautiful-talker to Mary.
<p>
</pre>has the place structure of “tavla”, but note the two distinct interpretations.
<p>
Now, using conversion, we can modify the place structure order:
9.11)	la meris.	[cu]	melbi se tavla	la tam.
	Mary
is beautifully-talked-to	by Tom.
	Mary is a beautiful-audience for Tom.
<p>
</pre>and we see that the modification has been changed so as to focus on Mary's role in the bridi relationship, leading to a different set of possible interpretations.
<p>
Note that there is no place structure change if the modifying term is converted, and so less drastic variation in possible meanings:
9.12)	la tam.	[cu]	tavla melbi 	la meris.
	Tom
is talkerly-beautiful	to Mary.
<p>
9.13)	la tam.	[cu]	se tavla melbi 	la meris.
	Tom
is audiencely-beautiful	to Mary.

</pre>and we see that the manner in which Tom is seen as beautiful by Mary changes, but Tom is still the one perceived as beautiful, and Mary, the observer of beauty.
<p>
<a name=s10><h3>Description sumti</h3>
<p>
<cx "descriptions (quick-tour version)">  XE "descriptions: quick-tour version"   <ex "talker">  XE "talker: example“  Often we wish to talk about things other than the speaker, the listener and things we can point to. Let's say I want to talk about a talker other than “mi”. What I want to talk about would naturally fit into the first place of “tavla”. Lojban, it turns out, has an operator that pulls this first place out of a selbri and converts it to a sumti called a “description sumti”. The description sumti “le tavla ku” means “the talker”, and may be used wherever any sumti may be used.
<p>
For example,
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d1>10.1)	mi tavla do le tavla ku
</pre>means the same as
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d2>10.2)	I talk to you about the talker
</pre>where “the talker” is presumably someone other than me, though not necessarily.
<p>
Similarly “le sutra tavla ku” is “the fast talker”, and “le sutra te tavla ku” is “the fast subject of talk” or “the subject of fast talk”. Which of these related meanings is understood will depend on the context in which the expression is used. The most plausible interpretation within the context will generally be assumed by a listener to be the intended one.
<p>
In many cases the word “ku” may be omitted. In particular, it is never necessary in a description at the end of a sentence, so:
10.3)	mi	tavla	do	le tavla
	I	talk-to	you	about-the talker.
<p>
</pre>means exactly the same thing as <a href=#e10d1>Example 10.1</a>. 
<p>
<cx "cu, need for (quick-tour version)">  XE "cu: need for, quick-tour version"   There is a problem when we want to say “The fast one is talking.” The “obvious” translation “le sutra tavla” turns out to mean “the fast talker”, and has no selbri at all. To solve this problem we can use the word “cu”, which so far has always been optional, in front of the selbri.
<p>
The word “cu” has no meaning, and exists only to mark the beginning of the selbri within the bridi, separating it from a previous sumti. It comes before any other part of the selbri, including other cmavo like “se” or “te”. Thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d4>10.4)	le sutra tavla
	The fast talker
<a name=e10d5>10.5)	le sutra cu tavla
	The fast one is talking.
<a name=e10d6>10.6)	le sutra se tavla
	The fast talked-to one
<a name=e10d7>10.7)	le sutra cu se tavla
	The fast one is talked to.
</pre><cx "ku (quick-tour version)">  XE "ku: quick-tour version"   <cx "KU (quick-tour version)">  XE "KU selma’o: quick-tour version"   Consider the following more complex example, with two description sumti.
10.8)	mi	[cu]	tavla	le vecnu [ku]	le blari’o [ku]
	I
talk-to	the seller	about the blue-green-thing.
<p>
</pre><p>The sumti “le vecnu” contains the selbri “vecnu”, which has the “seller” in the x1 place, and uses it in this sentence to describe a particular “seller” that the speaker has in mind (one that he or she probably expects the listener will also know about). Similarly, the speaker has a particular blue-green thing in mind, which is described using “le” to mark “blari'o”, a selbri whose first sumti is something blue-green.
<p>
It is safe to omit both occurrences of “ku” in <a href=#e10d8>Example 10.8 </a>, and it is also safe to omit the “cu”.
<p>
<a name=s11><h3>Examples of brivla</h3>
<p>
<cx "brivla, types of (quick-tour version)">  XE "brivla: types of, quick-tour version"   The simplest form of selbri is an individual word. A word which may by itself express a selbri relation is called a “brivla”. The three types of brivla are gismu (root words), lujvo (compounds), and fu'ivla (borrowings from other languages). All have identical grammatical uses. So far, most of our selbri have been gismu or tanru built from gismu.
<p>
<cx "gismu (quick-tour version)">  XE "gismu: quick-tour version"   gismu:
11.1)	mi	[cu]	klama	ti	zo’e	zo’e	ta
	Go-er
goes	destination	origin	route	means.
	I go here (to this) using that means (from somewhere via some route).
<p>
</pre><cx "lujvo (quick-tour version)">  XE "lujvo: quick-tour version"   lujvo:
11.2)	ta	[cu]	blari’o
	That
is-blue-green.
<p>
</pre><cx "fu'ivla (quick-tour version)">  XE "fu'ivla: quick-tour version"   fu'ivla:
11.3)	ti	[cu]	djarspageti
	This
is-spaghetti.
<p>
</pre><cx "cmavo as selbri (quick-tour version)">  XE "cmavo as selbri: quick-tour version"   Some cmavo may also serve as selbri, acting as variables that stand for another selbri. The most commonly used of these is “go'i”, which represents the main bridi of the previous Lojban sentence, with any new sumti or other sentence features being expressed replacing the previously expressed ones. Thus, in this context:
11.4)	ta	[cu]	go’i
	That
too/same-as-last selbri.
	That (is spaghetti), too.
<p>
</pre><a name=s12><h3>The sumti “di'u” and “la'e di'u”</h3>
<p>
<cx "reference (quick-tour version)">  XE "reference: quick-tour version"   In English, I might say “The dog is beautiful”, and you might reply “This pleases me.” How do you know what “this” refers to? Lojban uses different expressions to convey the possible meanings of the English:
<p>
<ex "beautiful dog">  XE "beautiful dog: example“  <pre><a name=e12d1>12.1)	le gerku [ku] cu melbi
	The dog is beautiful.
</pre><p>The following three sentences all might translate as “This pleases me.”
<p>
<cx "pleases">  XE "pleases"   <pre><a name=e12d2>12.2)	ti [cu] pluka mi
	This (the dog) pleases me.
</pre><lx "di'u (quick-tour version)">  XE "di'u: quick-tour version"   <pre><a name=e12d3>12.3)	di'u [cu] pluka mi
	This (the last sentence) pleases me (perhaps because it is grammatical
or sounds nice).
</pre><lx "la'edi'u (quick-tour version)">  XE "la'edi'u: quick-tour version"   <pre><a name=e12d4>12.4)	la'e di'u [cu] pluka mi
	This (the meaning of the last sentence; i.e. that the dog is beautiful) 
pleases me.
</pre><a href=#e12d4>Example 12.4 </a>uses one sumti to point to or refer to another by inference. It is common to write “la'edi'u” as a single word; it is used more often than “di'u” by itself.
<p>
<a name=s13><h3>Possession</h3>
<p>
<cx "possession (quick-tour version)">  XE "possession: quick-tour version"   “Possession” refers to the concept of specifying an object by saying who it belongs to (or with). A full explanation of Lojban possession is given in <a href=chap8.html>Chapter 8</a>. A simple means of expressing possession, however, is to place a sumti representing the possessor of an object within the description sumti that refers to the object: specifically, between the “le” and the selbri of the description:
13.1)	le mi gerku	cu	sutra
	The of-me dog
is fast.
	My dog is fast.

<p>
</pre><cx "possession not ownership (quick-tour version)">  XE "possession not ownership: quick-tour version"   In Lojban, possession doesn't necessarily mean ownership: one may “possess” a chair simply by sitting on it, even though it actually belongs to someone else. English uses possession casually in the same way, but also uses it to refer to actual ownership or even more intimate relationships: “my arm” doesn't mean “some arm I own” but rather “the arm that is part of my body”. Lojban has methods of specifying all these different kinds of possession precisely and easily.

<cx "vocatives (quick-tour version)">  XE "vocatives: quick-tour version"   <lx "doi (quick-tour version)">  XE "doi: quick-tour version"   <lx "DOI (quick-tour version)">  XE "DOI selma’o: quick-tour version"   You may call someone's attention to the fact that you are addressing them by using “doi” followed by their name. The sentence
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d1>14.1)	doi djan.
</pre>means “Oh, John, I'm talking to you”. It also has the effect of setting the value of “do”; “do” now refers to “John” until it is changed in some way in the conversation. Note that <a href=#e14d1>Example 14.1 </a>is not a bridi, but it is a legitimate Lojban sentence nevertheless; it is known as a “vocative phrase”.
<p>
<lx "coi (quick-tour version)">  XE "coi: quick-tour version"   <lx "co'o (quick-tour version)">  XE "co'o: quick-tour version"   Other cmavo can be used instead of “doi” in a vocative phrase, with a different significance. For example, the cmavo “coi” means “hello” and “co'o” means “good-bye”. Either word may stand alone, they may follow one another, or either may be followed by a pause and a name. (Vocative phrases with “doi” do not need a pause before the name.)
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d2>14.2)	coi. djan.
	Hello, John.
<a name=e14d3>14.3)	co'o. djan.
	Good-bye, John.
</pre><cx "commands (quick-tour version)">  XE "commands: quick-tour version"   <cx "imperatives (quick-tour version)">  XE "imperatives: quick-tour version"   Commands are expressed in Lojban by a simple variation of the main bridi structure. If you say
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d4>14.4)	do tavla
	You are-talking.
</pre>you are simply making a statement of fact. In order to issue a command in Lojban, substitute the word “ko” for “do”. The bridi
<p>
<ex "Talk!">  XE "Talk!: example“  <lx "ko (quick-tour version)">  XE "ko: quick-tour version"   <pre><a name=e14d5>14.5)	ko tavla
</pre>instructs the listener to do whatever is necessary to make <a href=#e14d4>Example 14.4 true; it means “Talk!”  Other examples:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d6>14.6)	ko sutra
	Be fast!
</pre><p>The “ko” need not be in the x1 place, but rather can occur anywhere a sumti is allowed, leading to possible Lojban commands that are very unlike English commands:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d7>14.7)	mi tavla ko
	Be talked to by me.
	Let me talk to you.
</pre><p>The cmavo “ko” can fill any appropriate sumti place, and can be used as often as is appropriate for the selbri:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d8>14.8)	ko kurji ko
</pre>and
<p>
<ex "Take care!">  XE "Take care!: example“  <pre><a name=e14d9>14.9)	ko ko kurji
</pre>both mean “You take care of you” and “Be taken care of by you”, or to put it colloquially, “Take care of yourself”.
<p>
<a name=s15><h3>Questions</h3>
<p>
<cx "questions (quick-tour version)">  XE "questions: quick-tour version"   There are many kinds of questions in Lojban: full explanations appear in <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19 </a>and in various other chapters throughout the book. In this chapter, we will introduce three kinds: sumti questions, selbri questions, and yes/no questions.
<p>
<cx "questions (quick-tour version)">  XE "questions: quick-tour version"   <cx "sumti questions (quick-tour version)">  XE "sumti questions: quick-tour version"   <lx "ma (quick-tour version)">  XE "ma: quick-tour version"   The cmavo “ma” is used to create a sumti question: it indicates that the speaker wishes to know the sumti which should be placed at the location of the “ma” to make the bridi true. It can be translated as “Who?” or “What?” in most cases, but also serves for “When?”, “Where?”, and “Why?” when used in sumti places that express time, location, or cause. For example:
15.1)	ma	tavla	do	mi
	Who?	talks	to-you	about-me.
	Who is talking to you about me?

<p>
</pre><p>The listener can reply by simply stating a sumti:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d2>15.2)	la djan.
	John (is talking to you about me).

</pre><p>Like “ko”, “ma” can occur in any position where a sumti is allowed, not just in the first position:
15.3)	do	[cu]	tavla	ma
	You
talk	to what/whom?
<p>
</pre><p>A “ma” can also appear in multiple sumti positions in one sentence, in effect asking several questions at once.
15.4)	ma	[cu]	tavla	ma
	What/Who
talks	to what/whom?
<p>
</pre><cx "separate questions (quick-tour version)">  XE "separate questions: quick-tour version"   The two separate “ma” positions ask two separate questions, and can therefore be answered with different values in each sumti place.
<p>
<cx "selbri questions (quick-tour version)">  XE "selbri questions: quick-tour version"   <cx "bridi questions (quick-tour version)">  XE "bridi questions: quick-tour version"   <lx "mo (quick-tour version)">  XE "mo: quick-tour version"   The cmavo “mo” is the selbri analogue of “ma”. It asks the respondent to provide a selbri that would be a true relation if inserted in place of the “mo”:
15.5)	do	[cu]	mo
	You
are-what/do-what?
<p>
</pre><p>A “mo” may be used anywhere a brivla or other selbri might. Keep this in mind for later examples. Unfortunately, by itself, “mo” is a very non-specific question. The response to the question in <a href=#e15d5>Example 15.5 </a>could be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d6>15.6)	mi [cu] melbi
	I am beautiful.
</pre>or:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d7>15.7)	mi [cu] tavla
	I talk.
</pre><cx "speaker-listener cooperation">  XE "speaker-listener cooperation"   Clearly, “mo” requires some cooperation between the speaker and the respondent to ensure that the right question is being answered. If context doesn't make the question specific enough, the speaker must ask the question more specifically using a more complex construction such as a tanru (see <a href=#s9>Section 9</a>).
<p>
It is perfectly permissible for the respondent to fill in other unspecified places in responding to a “mo” question. Thus, the respondent in <a href=#e15d7>Example 15.7 </a>could have also specified an audience, a topic, and/or a language in the response.
<p>
<cx "yes/no questions (quick-tour version)">  XE "yes/no questions: quick-tour version"   Finally, we must consider questions that can be answered “Yes” or “No”, such as
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d8>15.8)	Are you talking to me?
</pre><p>Like all yes-or-no questions in English, <a href=#e15d8>Example 15.8 </a>may be reformulated as
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d9>15.9)	Is it true that you are talking to me?
</pre><lx "xu (quick-tour version)">  XE "xu: quick-tour version"   In Lojban we have a word that asks precisely that question in precisely the same way. The cmavo “xu”, when placed in front of a bridi, asks whether that bridi is true as stated. So
15.10)	xu	do	tavla	mi
	Is-it-true-that	you	are-talking	to-me?
<p>
</pre>is the Lojban translation of <a href=#e15d8>Example 15.8</a>.
<p>
<cx "go'i with xu (quick-tour version)">  XE "go'i with xu: quick-tour version"   <cx "affirmative answer (quick-tour version)">  XE "affirmative answer: quick-tour version"   The answer “Yes” may be given by simply restating the bridi without the “xu” question word. Lojban has a shorthand for doing this with the word “go'i”, mentioned in <a href=#s11>Section 11</a>. Instead of a negative answer, the bridi may be restated in such a way as to make it true. If this can be done by substituting sumti, it may be done with “go'i” as well. For example:
<p>
<ex "healthy">  XE "healthy: example“  <pre><a name=e15d11>15.11)	xu do kanro
	Are you healthy?
</pre>can be answered with
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d12>15.12)	mi kanro
	I am healthy.
</pre>or
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d13>15.13)	go'i
	I am healthy.
</pre>(Note that “do” to the questioner is “mi” to the respondent.)
<p>
or
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d14>15.14)	le tavla cu kanro
	The talker is healthy.
</pre>or
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d15>15.15)	le tavla cu go'i
	The talker is healthy.
</pre><lx "nago'i (quick-tour version)">  XE "nago'i: quick-tour version"   <cx "negative answer (quick-tour version)">  XE "negative answer: quick-tour version"   A general negative answer may be given by “na go'i”. “na” may be placed before any selbri (but after the “cu”). It is equivalent to stating “It is not true that <dots>…</dots>” before the bridi. It does not imply that anything else is true or untrue, only that that specific bridi is not true. More details on negative statements are available in <a href=chap15.html>Chapter 15</a>.
<p>
<a name=s16><h3>Indicators</h3>
<p>
<cx "indicators (quick-tour version)">  XE "indicators: quick-tour version"   <cx "attitudinal indicators (quick-tour version)">  XE "attitudinal indicators: quick-tour version"   <cx "interjections (quick-tour version)">  XE "interjections: quick-tour version"   Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included in written language. Some of these are available in some languages as interjections (i.e. Aha!, Oh no!, Ouch!, Aahh!, etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.
<p>
Lojban has a group of cmavo known as “attitudinal indicators” which specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements. They are both written and spoken, but require no specific intonation or gestures. Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left. For example:
<p>
<lx "UI (quick-tour version)">  XE "UI selma’o: quick-tour version"   <pre><a name=e16d1>16.1)	.ie mi [cu] klama
	Agreement! I go.
	Yep! I'll go.
<a name=e16d2>16.2)	.ei mi [cu] klama
	Obligation! I go.
	I should go.


<a name=e16d3>16.3)	mi [cu] klama le melbi .ui [ku]
	I go to the beautiful-thing (and I am happy because it is the beautiful
thing I'm going to).
</pre><cx "discursives (quick-tour version)">  XE "discursives: quick-tour version"   <cx "metalinguistic words (quick-tour version)">  XE "metalinguistic words: quick-tour version"   <cx "but/and equivalence">  XE "but/and equivalence"   Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear separation of these so-called “metalinguistic” features from the underlying statements and logical structure. By comparison, the English words “but” and “also”, which discursively indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically equivalent to “and”, which does not have a discursive content. The average English-speaker does not think about, and may not even realize, the paradoxical idea that “but” basically means “and”.
<p>
<pre><a name=e16d4>16.4)	mi [cu] klama  .i do [cu] stali
	I go.  You stay.
<a name=e16d5>16.5)	mi [cu] klama  .i ji'a do [cu] stali
	I go.  In addition, you stay.  (added weight)
<a name=e16d6>16.6)	mi [cu] klama  .i ku'i do [cu] stali
	I go.  However, you stay.  (contrast)
</pre><cx "evidentials (quick-tour version)">  XE "evidentials: quick-tour version"   Another group of indicators are called “evidentials”. Evidentials show the speaker's relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These include “za'a” (I directly observe the relationship), “pe'i” (I believe that the relationship holds), “ru'a” (I postulate the relationship), and others. Many American Indian languages use this kind of words.
<p>
<pre><a name=e16d7>16.7)	pe'i do [cu] melbi
	I opine!  You are beautiful.
<a name=e16d8>16.8)	za'a do [cu] melbi
	I directly observe!  You are beautiful.
</pre><a name=s17><h3>Tenses</h3>
<p>
<cx "tenses (quick-tour version)">  XE “tense: quick-tour version"   <cx "time tenses (quick-tour version)">  XE "time tenses: quick-tour version"   In English, every verb is tagged for the grammatical category called tense: past, present, or future. The sentence
<p>
<pre><a name=e17d1>17.1)	John went to the store
</pre>necessarily happens at some time in the past, whereas
<p>
<pre><a name=e17d2>17.2)	John is going to the store
</pre>is necessarily happening right now.
<p>
<cx "sentences, tenseless (quick-tour version)">  XE "sentences: tenseless, quick-tour version"   The Lojban sentence
<p>
17.3)	la djan.	[cu]	klama	le zarci
	John
goes/went/will-go	to-the store.
</pre>serves as a translation of either <a href=#e17d1>Example 17.1 </a>or <a href=#e17d2>Example 17.2</a>, and of many other possible English sentences as well. It is not marked for tense, and can refer to an event in the past, the present or the future. This rule does not mean that Lojban has no way of representing the time of an event. A close translation of <a href=#e17d1>Example 17.1 </a>would be:
17.4)	la djan.	pu klama	le zarci
	John	[past] goes	to-the store.
<p>
</pre>where the tag “pu” forces the sentence to refer to a time in the past. Similarly,
17.5)	la djan.	ca klama	le zarci
	John	[present] goes	to-the store.
<p>
</pre>necessarily refers to the present, because of the tag “ca”. Tags used in this way always appear at the very beginning of the selbri, just after the “cu”, and they may make a “cu” unnecessary, since tags cannot be absorbed into tanru. Such tags serve as an equivalent to English tenses and adverbs. In Lojban, tense information is completely optional. If unspecified, the appropriate tense is picked up from context.
<p>
<cx "space tenses (quick-tour version)">  XE "space tenses: quick-tour version"   Lojban also extends the notion of “tense” to refer not only to time but to space. The following example uses the tag “vu” to specify that the event it describes happens far away from the speaker:
17.6)	do	vu vecnu	zo’e
	You	yonder sell	something-unspecified.
<p>
</pre><p>In addition, tense tags (either for time or space) can be prefixed to the selbri of a description, producing a tensed sumti:
17.7)	le pu bajra [ku]	cu	tavla
	The earlier/former/past runner
talked/talks.
<p>
</pre>(Since Lojban tense is optional, we don't know when he or she talks.)
<p>
Tensed sumti with space tags correspond roughly to the English use of “this” or “that” as adjectives, as in the following example, which uses the tag “vi” meaning “nearby”:
17.8)	le vi bajra [ku]	cu	tavla
	The nearby runner
talks.
	This runner talks.
<p>
</pre><p>Do not confuse the use of “vi” in <a href=#e17d8>Example 17.8 </a>with the cmavo “ti”, which also means “this”, but in the sense of “this thing”.
<p>
<cx "sumti with tenses (quick-tour version)">  XE "sumti with tenses: quick-tour version"   Furthermore, a tense tag can appear both on the selbri and within a description, as in the following example (where “ba” is the tag for future time):
17.9)	le vi bajra [ku]	cu	ba klama
	The here runner
[future] goes.
	The talker who is here will go.
	This talker will go.
<p>
</pre><a name=s18><h3>Lojban grammatical terms</h3>
<p>
<cx "grammatical terms (quick-tour version)">  XE "grammatical terms: quick-tour version"   Here is a review of the Lojban grammatical terms used in this chapter, plus some others used throughout this book. Only terms that are themselves Lojban words are included: there are of course many expressions like “indicator” in <a href=chap16.html>Chapter 16 </a>that are not explained here. See the Index for further help with these.
<p>
<cx "bridi, definition (quick-tour version)">  XE "bridi: definition, quick-tour version"   <dl compact><dt>bridi:  <dd>predication; the basic unit of Lojban expression; the main kind of Lojban sentence; a claim that some objects stand in some relationship, or that some single object has some property.

See <a href=chap4.html>Chapter 4 </a>and <a href=chap12.html>Chapter 12</a>.

</dl><cx "rafsi, definition (quick-tour version)">  XE "rafsi: definition, quick-tour version"   <dl compact><dt>rafsi:  <dd>a word fragment; one or more is associated with each gismu; can be assembled according to rules in order to make lujvo; not a valid word by itself. See <a href=chap4.html>Chapter 4</a>.

The Hills Are Alive With The Sounds Of Lojban</h2>

<p>
<a name=s1><h3>Orthography</h3>
<p>
<cx "isomorphism, audio-visual">  XE "isomorphism: audio-visual"   <cx "audio-visual isomorphism">  XE "audio-visual isomorphism"   <cx "pronunciation, relation to orthography">  XE "pronunciation: relation to orthography"   <cx "orthography, relation to pronunciation">  XE "orthography: relation to pronunciation"   Lojban is designed so that any properly spoken Lojban utterance can be uniquely transcribed in writing, and any properly written Lojban can be spoken so as to be uniquely reproduced by another person. As a consequence, the standard Lojban orthography must assign to each distinct sound, or phoneme, a unique letter or symbol. Each letter or symbol has only one sound or, more accurately, a limited range of sounds that are permitted pronunciations for that phoneme. Some symbols indicate stress (speech emphasis) and pause, which are also essential to Lojban word recognition. In addition, everything that is represented in other languages by punctuation (when written) or by tone of voice (when spoken) is represented in Lojban by words. These two properties together are known technically as “audio-visual isomorphism”.
<p>
<cx "Latin alphabet">  XE "Latin alphabet"   <cx "Lojban alphabet">  XE "Lojban alphabet"   <cx "alphabet, Lojban">  XE "alphabet: Lojban"   Lojban uses a variant of the Latin (Roman) alphabet, consisting of the following letters and symbols:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>	' , . a b c d e f g i j k l m n o p r s t u v x y z
</dl>omitting the letters “h”, “q”, and “w”.
<p>
<cx "alphabetic order">  XE "alphabetic order"   The alphabetic order given above is that of the ASCII coded character set, widely used in computers. By making Lojban alphabetical order the same as ASCII, computerized sorting and searching of Lojban text is facilitated.
<p>
<cx "capital letters, use of">  XE "capital letters: use of"   <cx "stress, showing non-standard">  XE "stress: showing non-standard"   Capital letters are used only to represent non-standard stress, which can appear only in the representation of Lojbanized names. Thus the English name “Josephine”, as normally pronounced, is Lojbanized as “DJOsefin.”, pronounced <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[ÈdZo sE fin/]</font>. (See <a href=#s2>Section 2 </a>for an explanation of the symbols within square brackets.) Technically, it is sufficient to capitalize the vowel letter, in this case “O”, but it is easier on the reader to capitalize the whole syllable.
<p>
Without the capitalization, the ordinary rules of Lojban stress would cause the “se” syllable to be stressed. Lojbanized names are meant to represent the pronunciation of names from other languages with as little distortion as may be; as such, they are exempt from many of the regular rules of Lojban phonology, as will appear in the rest of this chapter.
<p>
<a name=s2><h3>Basic phonetics</h3>
<p>
<cx "International Phonetic Alphabet (see also IPA)">  XE "International Phonetic Alphabet (see also IPA)"   <cx "IPA">  XE "IPA"   <cx "phonetic alphabet">  XE "phonetic alphabet"   <cx "brackets, use in IPA notation">  XE "brackets: use in IPA notation"   Lojban pronunciations are defined using the International Phonetic Alphabet, or IPA, a standard method of transcribing pronunciations. By convention, IPA transcriptions are always within square brackets: for example, the word “cat” is pronounced (in General American pronunciation) <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[kQt]</font>. <a href=#s10>Section 10 </a>contains a brief explanation of the IPA characters used in this chapter, with their nearest analogues in English, and will be especially useful to those not familiar with the technical terms used in describing speech sounds.
<p>
<cx "pronunciation, standard">  XE "pronunciation: standard"   <cx "standard pronunciation">  XE "standard pronunciation"   The standard pronunciations and permitted variants of the Lojban letters are listed in the table below. The descriptions have deliberately been made a bit ambiguous to cover variations in pronunciation by speakers of different native languages and dialects. In all cases except “r” the first IPA symbol shown represents the preferred pronunciation; for “r”, all of the variations (and any other rhotic sound) are equally acceptable.

</pre><cx "clarity of sounds">  XE "clarity of sounds"   <cx "sounds, clarity of">  XE "sounds: clarity of"   The Lojban sounds must be clearly pronounced so that they are not mistaken for each other. Voicing and placement of the tongue are the key factors in correct pronunciation, but other subtle differences will develop between consonants in a Lojban-speaking community. At this point these are the only mandatory rules on the range of sounds.
<p>
<cx "rounded/unrounded vowels">  XE "rounded/unrounded vowels"   Note in particular that Lojban vowels can be pronounced with either rounded or unrounded lips; typically “o” and “u” are rounded and the others are not, as in English, but this is not a requirement; some people round “y” as well. Lojban consonants can be aspirated or unaspirated. Palatalizing of consonants, as found in Russian and other languages, is not generally acceptable in pronunciation, though a following “i” may cause it.
<p>
<cx "sounds, difficult">  XE "sounds: difficult"   <cx "sounds for letters, Lojban contrasted with English">  XE "sounds for letters: Lojban contrasted with English"   The sounds represented by the letters “c”, “g”, “j”, “s”, and “x” require special attention for speakers of English, either because they are ambiguous in the orthography of English (“c”, “g”, “s”), or because they are strikingly different in Lojban (“c”, “j”, “x”). The English “c” represents three different sounds, <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[k] </font>in “cat” and <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[s] </font>in “cent”, as well as the <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[S] </font>of “ocean”. Similarly, English “g” can represent <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[g] </font>as in “go”, <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[dZ] </font>as in “gentle”, and <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[Z] </font>as in the second “g” in “garage” (in some pronunciations). English “s” can be either <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[s] </font>as in “cats”, <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[z] </font>as in “cards”, <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[S] </font>as in “tension”, or <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[Z] </font>as in “measure”. The sound of Lojban “x” doesn't appear in most English dialects at all.
<p>
<cx "sounds, complex">  XE "sounds: complex"   <cx "“ts”-sound in Russian, representation in Lojban">  XE "ts-sound in Russian: representation in Lojban"   <cx "“ch”-sound in English, representation in Lojban">  XE "ch-sound in English: representation in Lojban"   <cx "“j”-sound in English, representation in Lojban">  XE "j-sound in English: representation in Lojban"   There are two common English sounds that are found in Lojban but are not Lojban consonants: the “ch” of “church” and the “j” of “judge”. In Lojban, these are considered two consonant sounds spoken together without an intervening vowel sound, and so are represented in Lojban by the two separate consonants: “tc” (IPA <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[tS]</font>) and “dj” (IPA <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[dZ]</font>). In general, whether a complex sound is considered one sound or two depends on the language: Russian views “ts” as a single sound, whereas English, French, and Lojban consider it to be a consonant cluster.
<p>
<a name=s3><h3>The special Lojban characters</h3>
<p>
<cx "characters, special">  XE "characters: special"   The apostrophe, period, and comma need special attention. They are all used as indicators of a division between syllables, but each has a different pronunciation, and each is used for different reasons:
<p>
<cx "apostrophe, definition of">  XE "apostrophe: definition of"   <cx "“ ' ”, definition (see also apostrophe)">  XE " ' symbol: definition (see also apostrophe)"   <cx "apostrophe, type of letter in word-formation">  XE "apostrophe: type of letter in word-formation"   The apostrophe represents a phoneme similar to a short, breathy English “h”, (IPA <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[h]</font>). The letter “h” is not used to represent this sound for two reasons: primarily in order to simplify explanations of the morphology, but also because the sound is very common, and the apostrophe is a visually lightweight representation of it. The apostrophe sound is a consonant in nature, but is not treated as either a consonant or a vowel for purposes of Lojban morphology (word-formation), which is explained in <a href=chap4.html>Chapter 4</a>. In addition, the apostrophe visually parallels the comma and the period, which are also used (in different ways) to separate syllables.
<p>
<cx "apostrophe, purpose of">  XE "apostrophe: purpose of"   <cx "unvoiced vowel glide, apostrophe as">  XE "unvoiced vowel glide: apostrophe as"   The apostrophe is included in Lojban only to enable a smooth transitionseparation between vowels, while joining the vowels within a single word. In fact, one way to think of the apostrophe is as representing a unvoiced vowel glide.
<p>
<cx "apostrophe, variant of">  XE "apostrophe: variant of"   As a permitted variant, any unvoiced fricative other than those already used in Lojban may be used to render the apostrophe: IPA <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[T] </font>is one possibility. The convenience of the listener should be regarded as paramount in deciding to use a substitute for <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[h]</font>.
<p>
<cx "period, definition of">  XE "period: definition of"   <cx "glottal stop, as pause in Lojban">  XE "glottal stop: as pause in Lojban"   <cx "pause, representation of in Lojban">  XE "pause: representation of in Lojban"   The period represents a mandatory pause, with no specified length; a glottal stop (IPA <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[/]</font>) is considered a pause of shortest length. A pause (or glottal stop) may appear between any two words, and in certain cases – explained in detail in <a href=chap4.html>Chapter 4 </a>— must occur. In particular, a word beginning with a vowel is always preceded by a pause, and a word ending in a consonant is always followed by a pause.
<p>
<cx "period, optional">  XE "period: optional"   Technically, the period is an optional reminder to the reader of a mandatory pause that is dictated by the rules of the language; because these rules are unambiguous, a missing period can be inferred from otherwise correct text. Periods are included only as an aid to the reader.
<p>
<cx "period, within a word">  XE "period: within a word"   A period also may be found apparently embedded in a word. When this occurs, such a written string is not one word but two, written together to indicate that the writer intends a unitary meaning for the compound. It is not really necessary to use a space between words if a period appears.
<p>
<cx "comma, definition of">  XE "comma: definition of"   <cx "syllable break, representation in Lojban">  XE "syllable break: representation in Lojban"   <cx "syllable break, contrasted with pause">  XE "syllable break: contrasted with pause"   <cx "pause, contrasted with syllable break">  XE "pause: contrasted with syllable break"   The comma is used to indicate a syllable break within a word, generally one that is not obvious to the reader. Such a comma is written to separate syllables, but indicates that there must be no pause between them, in contrast to the period. Between two vowels, a comma indicates that some type of glide may be necessary to avoid a pause that would split the two syllables into separate words. It is always legal to use the apostrophe (IPA <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[h]</font>) sound in pronouncing a comma. However, a comma cannot be pronounced as a pause or glottal stop between the two letters separated by the comma, because that pronunciation would split the word into two words.
<p>
<cx "comma, main use of">  XE "comma: main use of"   <cx "comma, optional">  XE "comma: optional"   Otherwise, a comma is usually only used to clarify the presence of syllabic “l”, “m”, “n”, or “r” (discussed later). Commas are never required: no two Lojban words differ solely because of the presence or placement of a comma.
<p>
<ex "Old McDonald">  XE "Old McDonald: example“  Here is a somewhat artificial example of the difference in pronunciation between periods, commas and apostrophes. In the English song about Old MacDonald's Farm, the vowel string written “ee-i-ee-i-o” in English could be Lojbanized with periods as:
<p>
<cx "period, example of">  XE "period: example of"   <pre><a name=e3d1>3.1)	.i.ai.i.ai.o
	<font face="SILDoulosIPA">[/i /aj /i /aj /o]</font>
	Ee! Eye! Ee! Eye! Oh!
</pre><p>However, this would sound clipped, staccato, and unmusical compared to the English. Furthermore, although <a href=#e3d1>Example 3.1 </a>is a string of meaningful Lojban words, as a sentence it makes very little sense. (Note the use of periods embedded within the written word.)
<p>
If commas were used instead of periods, we could represent the English string as a Lojbanized name, ending in a consonant:
<p>
<cx "comma, example of">  XE "comma: example of"   <pre><a name=e3d2>3.2)	.i,ai,i,ai,on.
	<font face="SILDoulosIPA">[/i jaj ji jaj jon/]</font>
</pre><p>The commas represent new syllable breaks, but prohibit the use of pauses or glottal stop. The pronunciation shown is just one possibility, but closely parallels the intended English pronunciation.
<p>
<cx "comma, variant of">  XE "comma: variant of"   However, the use of commas in this way is risky to unambiguous interpretation, since the glides might be heard by some listeners as diphthongs, producing something like
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d3>3.3)	.i,iai,ii,iai,ion.
</pre>which is technically a different Lojban name. Since the intent with Lojbanized names is to allow them to be pronounced more like their native counterparts, the comma is allowed to represent vowel glides or some non-Lojbanic sound. Such an exception affects only spelling accuracy and the ability of a reader to replicate the desired pronunciation exactly; it will not affect the recognition of word boundaries.
<p>
<cx "apostrophe, as preferable over comma in names">  XE "apostrophe: as preferable over comma in names"   Still, it is better if Lojbanized names are always distinct. Therefore, the apostrophe is preferred in regular Lojbanized names that are not attempting to simulate a non-Lojban pronunciation perfectly. (Perfection, in any event, is not really achievable, because some sounds simply lack reasonable Lojbanic counterparts.)
<p>
If apostrophes were used instead of commas in <a href=#e3d2>Example 3.2</a>, it would appear as:
<p>
<cx "apostrophe, example of">  XE "apostrophe: example of"   <pre><a name=e3d4>3.4)	.i'ai'i'ai'on.
	<font face="SILDoulosIPA">[/i hai hi hai hon/]</font>
</pre>which preserves the rhythm and length, if not the exact sounds, of the original English.
<p>
<a name=s4><h3>Diphthongs and syllabic consonants</h3>
<p>
<cx "diphthongs, definition of">  XE "diphthongs: definition of"   There exist 16 diphthongs in the Lojban language. A diphthong is a vowel sound that consists of two elements, a short vowel sound and a glide, either a labial (IPA <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[w]</font>) or palatal (IPA <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[j]</font>) glide, that either precedes (an on-glide) or follows (an off-glide) the main vowel. Diphthongs always constitute a single syllable.
<p>
<cx "consonants, contrasted with vowels">  XE "consonants: contrasted with vowels"   <cx "vowels, contrasted with consonants">  XE "vowels: contrasted with consonants"   For Lojban purposes, a vowel sound is a relatively long speech-sound that forms the nucleus of a syllable. Consonant sounds are relatively brief and normally require an accompanying vowel sound in order to be audible. Consonants may occur at the beginning or end of a syllable, around the vowel, and there may be several consonants in a cluster in either position. Each separate vowel sound constitutes a distinct syllable; consonant sounds do not affect the determination of syllables.
<p>
<cx "vowels, definition of">  XE "vowels: definition of"   The six Lojban vowels are “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, “u”, and “y”. The first five vowels appear freely in all kinds of Lojban words. The vowel “y” has a limited distribution: it appears only in Lojbanized names, in the Lojban names of the letters of the alphabet, as a glue vowel in compound words, and standing alone as a space-filler word (like English “uh” or “er”).
<p>
The Lojban diphthongs are shown in the table below. (Variant pronunciations have been omitted, but are much as one would expect based on the variant pronunciations of the separate vowel letters: “ai” may be pronounced <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[Aj]</font>, for example.)

</pre>(Approximate English equivalents of most of these diphthongs exist: see <a href=#s11>Section 11 for examples.)
<p>
<cx "diphthongs, classification of">  XE "diphthongs: classification of"   The first four diphthongs above (“ai”, “ei”, “oi”, and “au”, the ones with off-glides) are freely used in most types of Lojban words; the ten following ones are used only as stand-alone words and in Lojbanized names and borrowings; and the last two (“iy” and “uy”) are used only in Lojbanized names.
<p>
<cx "consonants, syllabic">  XE "consonants: syllabic"   <cx "syllabic consonants">  XE "syllabic consonants"   The syllabic consonants of Lojban, <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[l`]</font>, <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[m`]</font>, <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[n`]</font>, and <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[r`]</font>, are variants of the non-syllabic <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[l]</font>, <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[m]</font>, <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[n]</font>, and <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[r] </font>respectively. They normally have only a limited distribution, appearing in Lojban names and borrowings, although in principle any “l”, “m”, “n”, or “r” may be pronounced syllabically. If a syllabic consonant appears next to a “l”, “m”, “n”, or “r” that is not syllabic, it may not be clear which is which:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d1>4.1)	brlgan.
	<font face="SILDoulosIPA">[br`l gan]</font>
	or <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[brl` gan]</font>
</pre>is a hypothetical Lojbanized name with more than one valid pronunciation; however it is pronounced, it remains the same word.
<p>
<ex "Earl">  XE "Earl: example“  <cx "syllabic consonants, final in word">  XE "syllabic consonants: final in word"   Syllabic consonants are treated as consonants rather than vowels from the standpoint of Lojban morphology. Thus Lojbanized names, which are generally required to end in a consonant, are allowed to end with a syllabic consonant. An example is “rl.”, which is an approximation of the English name “Earl”, and has two syllabic consonants.
<p>
<cx "stress, effect of syllabic consonants on">  XE "stress: effect of syllabic consonants on"   <cx "syllabic consonants, effect on stress">  XE "syllabic consonants: effect on stress"   Syllables with syllabic consonants and no vowel are never stressed or counted when determining which syllables to stress (see <a href=#s9>Section 9</a>).

These two vowel sounds are connected (and separated) by an apostrophe. Lojban vowel pairs should be pronounced continuously with the <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[h] </font>sound between (and not by a glottal stop or pause, which would split the two vowels into separate words).
<p>
<cx "vowel pairs, contrasted with diphthongs">  XE "vowel pairs: contrasted with diphthongs"   <cx "diphthongs, contrasted with vowel pairs">  XE "diphthongs: contrasted with vowel pairs"   All vowel combinations are permitted in two-syllable pairs with the apostrophe separating them; this includes those which constitute diphthongs when the apostrophe is not included.

	y'a	y'e	y'i	y'o	y'u	y'y
</pre><cx "vowel pairs, involving “y”">  XE "vowel pairs: involving y"   Vowel pairs involving “y” appear only in Lojbanized names. They could appear in cmavo (structure words), but only “.y'y.” is so used — it is the Lojban name of the apostrophe letter (see <a href=chap17.html>Chapter 17</a>).
<p>
<cx "vowel pairs, grouping of">  XE "vowel pairs: grouping of"   When more than two vowels occur together in Lojban, the normal pronunciation pairs vowels from the left into syllables, as in the Lojbanized name:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	meiin.
	mei,in.
</pre><a href=#e5d1>Example 5.1 contains the diphthong “ei” followed by the vowel “i”. In order to indicate a different grouping, the comma must always be used, leading to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d2>5.2)	me,iin.
</pre>which contains the vowel “e” followed by the diphthong “ii”. In rough English representation, <a href=#e5d1>Example 5.1 </a>is “May Een”, whereas <a href=#e5d2>Example 5.2 </a>is “Meh Yeen”.
<p>
<a name=s6><h3>Consonant clusters</h3>
<p>
<cx "consonant, definition">  XE "consonant: definition"   <cx "consonant, effect on syllable count">  XE "consonant: effect on syllable count"   A consonant sound is a relatively brief speech-sound that precedes or follows a vowel sound in a syllable; its presence either preceding or following does not add to the count of syllables, nor is a consonant required in either position for any syllable. Lojban has seventeen consonants: for the purposes of this section, the apostrophe is not counted as a consonant.
<p>
<cx "consonants, voicing of">  XE "consonants: voicing of"   An important distinction dividing Lojban consonants is that of voicing. The following table shows the unvoiced consonants and the corresponding voiced ones:

Single consonant sounds are isolated by word boundaries or by intervening vowel sounds from other consonant sounds. Doubled consonant sounds are either lengthened like <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[s] </font>in English “hiss”, or repeated like <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[k] </font>in English “backcourt”. Consonant clusters consist of two or more single or doubled consonant sounds in a group, each of which is different from its immediate neighbor. In Lojban, doubled consonants are excluded altogether, and clusters are limited to two or three members, except in Lojbanized names.
<p>
<cx "consonants, position of">  XE "consonants: position of"   Consonants can occur in three positions in words: initial (at the beginning), medial (in the middle), and final (at the end). In many languages, the sound of a consonant varies depending upon its position in the word. In Lojban, as much as possible, the sound of a consonant is unrelated to its position. In particular, the common American English trait of changing a “t” between vowels into a “d” or even a flap (IPA <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[¨]</font>) is unacceptable in Lojban.
<p>
<cx "consonants, restrictions on">  XE "consonants: restrictions on"   <cx "consonants, final">  XE "consonants: final"   Lojban imposes no restrictions on the appearance of single consonants in any valid consonant position; however, no consonant (including syllabic consonants) occurs final in a word except in Lojbanized names.
<p>
<cx "consonant pairs, restrictions on">  XE "consonant pairs: restrictions on"   Pairs of consonants can also appear freely, with the following restrictions:

</dl><ex "James">  XE "James: example“  <cx "“y”, use in avoiding forbidden consonant pairs">  XE "y: use in avoiding forbidden consonant pairs"   These rules apply to all kinds of words, even Lojbanized names.

<a name=s7><h3>Initial consonant pairs</h3>
<p>
<cx "consonant pairs, initial">  XE "consonant pairs: initial"   The set of consonant pairs that may appear at the beginning of a word (excluding Lojbanized names) is far more restricted than the fairly large group of permissible consonant pairs described in <a href=#s6>Section 6</a>. Even so, it is more than English allows, although hopefully not more than English-speakers (and others) can learn to pronounce.

<a name=s8><h3>Buffering of consonant clusters</h3>
<p>
<cx "consonant clusters, buffering of">  XE "consonant clusters: buffering of"   <cx "buffer vowel">  XE "buffer vowel"   <cx "vowel, buffer">  XE "vowel: buffer"   Many languages do not have consonant clusters at all, and even those languages that do have them often allow only a subset of the full Lojban set. As a result, the Lojban design allows the use of a buffer sound between consonant combinations which a speaker finds unpronounceable. This sound may be any non-Lojbanic vowel which is clearly separable by the listener from the Lojban vowels. Some possibilities are IPA <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[I]</font>, <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[ö]</font>, <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[U]</font>, or even <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[Y]</font>, but there probably is no universally acceptable buffer sound. When using a consonant buffer, the sound should be made as short as possible. Two examples showing such buffering (we will use <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[I] </font>in this chapter) are:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d1>8.1)	vrusi
	<font face="SILDoulosIPA">[Èvru si]</font>
	or <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[vI Èru si]</font>

</pre><cx "buffer vowel, and stress">  XE "buffer vowel: and stress"   <cx "stress, effect of buffer vowel on">  XE "stress: effect of buffer vowel on"   When a buffer vowel is used, it splits each buffered consonant into its own syllable. However, the buffering syllables are never stressed, and are not counted in determining stress. They are, in effect, not really syllables to a Lojban listener, and thus their impact is ignored.
<p>
Here are more examples of unbuffered and buffered pronunciations:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d3>8.3)	klama
	<font face="SILDoulosIPA">[Èkla ma]</font>

	<font face="SILDoulosIPA">[Èxa pI cI kE]</font>
</pre><p>In <a href=#e8d4>Example 8.4</a>, we see that buffering vowels can be used in just some, rather than all, of the possible places: the second pronunciation buffers the “pc” consonant pair but not the “ck”. The third pronunciation buffers both.

It is important not to confuse the vowel “y”, which is pronounced <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[«]</font>, with the buffer, which has a variety of possible pronunciations and is never written. Consider the contrast between
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d6>8.6)	bongynanba
	<font face="SILDoulosIPA">[boN g« Ènan ba]</font>
</pre>an unlikely Lojban compound word meaning “bone bread” (note the use of <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[N] </font>as a representative of “n” before “g”) and

<p>
<pre><a name=e8d7>8.7)	bongnanba
	<font face="SILDoulosIPA">[boN Ègnan ba]</font>
</pre>a possible borrowing from another language (Lojban borrowings can only take a limited form). If <a href=#e8d7>Example 8.7 </a>were pronounced with buffering, as
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d8>8.8)	<font face="SILDoulosIPA">[boN gI Ènan ba]</font>
</pre>it would be very similar to <a href=#e8d6>Example 8.6</a>. Only a clear distinction between “y” and any buffering vowel would keep the two words distinct.
<p>
<cx "vowels, length of">  XE "vowels: length of"   <cx "buffer vowel, shortening of">  XE "buffer vowel: shortening of"   Since buffering is done for the benefit of the speaker in order to aid pronounceability, there is no guarantee that the listener will not mistake a buffer vowel for one of the six regular Lojban vowels. The buffer vowel should be as laxly pronounced as possible, as central as possible, and as short as possible. Furthermore, it is worthwhile for speakers who use buffers to pronounce their regular vowels a bit longer than usual, to avoid confusion with buffer vowels. The speakers of many languages will have trouble correctly hearing any of the suggested buffer vowels otherwise. By this guideline, <a href=#e8d8>Example 8.8 would be pronounced
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d9>8.9)	<font face="SILDoulosIPA">[boùN gI Ènaùn baù]</font>
</pre>with lengthened vowels.
<p>
<a name=s9><h3>Syllabication and stress</h3>
<p>
<cx "syllabication, definition of">  XE "syllabication: definition of"   A Lojban word has one syllable for each of its vowels, diphthongs, and syllabic consonants (referred to simply as “vowels” for the purposes of this section.) Syllabication rules determine which of the consonants separating two vowels belong to the preceding vowel and which to the following vowel. These rules are conventional only; the phonetic facts of the matter about how utterances are syllabified in any language are always very complex.
<p>
<cx "syllabication, rules for">  XE "syllabication: rules for"   A single consonant always belongs to the following vowel. A consonant pair is normally divided between the two vowels; however, if the pair constitute a valid initial consonant pair, they are normally both assigned to the following vowel. A consonant triple is divided between the first and second consonants. Apostrophes and commas, of course, also represent syllable breaks. Syllabic consonants usually appear alone in their syllables.
<p>
<cx "syllabication, and names">  XE "syllabication: and names"   It is permissible to vary from these rules in Lojbanized names. For example, there are no definitive rules for the syllabication of names with consonant clusters longer than three consonants. The comma is used to indicate variant syllabication or to explicitly mark normal syllabication.
<p>
<cx "syllabication, examples of">  XE "syllabication: examples of"   Here are some examples of Lojban syllabication:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	pujenaicajeba
	pu,je,nai,ca,je,ba
</pre><p>This word has no consonant pairs and is therefore syllabified before each medial consonant.
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d2>9.2)	ninmu
	nin,mu

</pre><p>This word is split at a consonant pair.
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d3>9.3)	fitpri
	fit,pri
</pre><p>This word is split at a consonant triple, between the first two consonants of the triple.
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d4>9.4)	sairgoi
	sair,goi
	sai,r,goi
</pre><p>This word contains the consonant pair “rg”; the “r” may be pronounced syllabically or not.
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d5>9.5)	klezba
	klez,ba
	kle,zba
</pre><p>This word contains the permissible initial pair “zb”, and so may be syllabicated either between “z” and “b” or before “zb”.
<p>
<cx "stress, definition of">  XE "stress: definition of"   <cx "stressed syllable, compared with stressed vowel">  XE "stressed syllable: compared with stressed vowel"   <cx "stressed vowel, compared with stressed syllable">  XE "stressed vowel: compared with stressed syllable"   Stress is a relatively louder pronunciation of one syllable in a word or group of words. Since every syllable has a vowel sound (or diphthong or syllabic consonant) as its nucleus, and the stress is on the vowel sound itself, the terms “stressed syllable” and “stressed vowel” are largely interchangeable concepts.
<p>
<cx "stress, rules for">  XE "stress: rules for"   Most Lojban words are stressed on the next-to-the-last, or penultimate, syllable. In counting syllables, however, syllables whose vowel is “y” or which contain a syllabic consonant (“l”, “m”, “n”, or “r”) are never counted. (The Lojban term for penultimate stress is “da'amoi terbasna”.) Similarly, syllables created solely by adding a buffer vowel, such as <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[I]</font>, are not counted.
<p>
<cx "stress, levels of">  XE "stress: levels of"   There are actually three levels of stress — primary, secondary, and weak. Weak stress is the lowest level, so it really means no stress at all. Weak stress is required for syllables containing “y”, a syllabic consonant, or a buffer vowel.
<p>
<cx "stress, primary">  XE "stress: primary"   <cx "cmavo, stress on">  XE "cmavo: stress on"   <cx "brivla, stress on">  XE "brivla: stress on"   <cx "names, stress on">  XE "names: stress on"   Primary stress is required on the penultimate syllable of Lojban content words (called “brivla”). Lojbanized names may be stressed on any syllable, but if a syllable other than the penultimate is stressed, the syllable (or at least its vowel) must be capitalized in writing. Lojban structural words (called “cmavo”) may be stressed on any syllable or none at all. However, primary stress may not be used in a syllable just preceding a brivla, unless a pause divides them; otherwise, the two words may run together.
<p>
<cx "stress, secondary">  XE "stress: secondary"   Secondary stress is the optional and non-distinctive emphasis used for other syllables besides those required to have either weak or primary stress. There are few rules governing secondary stress, which typically will follow a speaker's native language habits or preferences. Secondary stress can be used for contrast, or for emphasis of a point. Secondary stress can be emphasized at any level up to primary stress, although the speaker must not allow a false primary stress in brivla, since errors in word resolution could result.
<p>
<ex "Armstrong">  XE "Armstrong: example“  The following are Lojban words with stress explicitly shown:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d6>9.6)	dikyjvo
	DI,ky,jvo
</pre>(In a fully-buffered dialect, the pronunciation would be: <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[Èdi k« jI vo]</font>.) Note that the syllable “ky” is not counted in determining stress. The vowel “y” is never stressed in a normal Lojban context.
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d7>9.7)	.armstrong.
	.ARM,strong.
</pre><p>This is a Lojbanized version of the name “Armstrong”. The final “g” must be explicitly pronounced. With full buffering, the name would be pronounced:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d8>9.8)	<font face="SILDoulosIPA">[È/a rI mI sI tI ro nI gI/]</font>
</pre><p>However, there is no need to insert a buffer in every possible place just because it is inserted in one place: partial buffering is also acceptable. In every case, however, the stress remains in the same place: on the first syllable.
<p>
<cx "-ng, Lojban contrasted with English">  XE "-ng: Lojban contrasted with English"   The English pronunciation of “Armstrong”, as spelled in English, is not correct by Lojban standards; the letters “ng” in English represent a velar nasal (IPA <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[N]</font>) which is a single consonant. In Lojban, “ng” represents two separate consonants that must both be pronounced; you may not use <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[N] </font>to pronounce Lojban “ng”, although <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[Ng] </font>is acceptable. English speakers are likely to have to pronounce the ending with a buffer, as one of the following:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d9>9.9)	<font face="SILDoulosIPA">[È/arm stron gI/]</font>
	or <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[È/arm stroN gI/]</font>
	or even <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[È/arm stro nIg/]</font>
</pre><p>The normal English pronunciation of the name “Armstrong” could be Lojbanized as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d10>9.10)	.ARMstron.
</pre>since Lojban “n” is allowed to be pronounced as the velar nasal <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[N]</font>.
<p>
Here is another example showing the use of “y”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d11>9.11)	bisydja
	BI,sy,dja
	BI,syd,ja
</pre><p>This word is a compound word, or lujvo, built from the two affixes “bis” and “dja”. When they are joined, an impermissible consonant pair results: “sd”. In accordance with the algorithm for making lujvo, explained in <a href=chap4.html>Chapter 4</a>, a “y” is inserted to separate the impermissible consonant pair; the “y” is not counted as a syllable for purposes of stress determination.
<p>
<ex "syllabication, variants of">  XE "syllabication: variants of"   <pre><a name=e9d12>9.12)	da'udja
	da'UD,ja
	da'U,dja
</pre><p>These two syllabications sound the same to a Lojban listener — the association of unbuffered consonants in syllables is of no import in recognizing the word.
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d13>9.13)	e'u bridi
	e'u BRI,di
	E'u BRI,di
	e'U.BRI,di
</pre><p>In <a href=#e9d13>Example 9.13</a>, “e'u” is a cmavo and “bridi” is a brivla. Either of the first two pronunciations is permitted: no primary stress on either syllable of “e'u”, or primary stress on the first syllable. The third pronunciation, which places primary stress on the second syllable of the cmavo, requires that — since the following word is a brivla — the two words must be separated by a pause. Consider the following two cases:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d14>9.14)	le re nobli prenu
	le re NObli PREnu
<a name=e9d15>9.15)	le re no bliprenu
	le re no bliPREnu
</pre><p>If the cmavo “no” in <a href=#e9d15>Example 9.15 </a>were to be stressed, the phrase would sound exactly like the given pronunciation of <a href=#e9d14>Example 9.14</a>, which is unacceptable in Lojban: a single pronunciation cannot represent both.

All the symbols used in this chapter are repeated here, in more or less alphabetical order, with examples drawn from General American. In addition, some attention is given to the Received Pronunciation of (British) English. These two dialects are referred to as GA and RP respectively.

Because schwa is a distinct vowel in Lojban, English speakers must either learn to avoid this shift or to use <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[a] </font>instead: the Lojban word for “sofa” is “sfofa”, pronounced <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[sfofa] </font>or <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[sfofA] </font>but never <font face="SILDoulosIPA">[sfof«] </font>which would be the non-word “sfofy”.

<dl compact><dt><dd>“ai”, “ei”, “oi”, “au” become “ai”, “ei”, “oi”, “ao”.
<p><dt><dd>“ia” through “iu” and “ua” through “uu” remain unchanged.
<p><dt><dd>“a'i”, “e'i”, “o'i” and “a'o” become “a,i”, “e,i”, “o,i” and “a,o”.
<p><dt><dd>“i'a” through “i'u” and “u'a” through “u'u” are changed to “ia” through “iu” and “ua” through “uu” in lujvo and cmavo other than attitudinals, but become “i,a” through “i,u” and “u,a” through “u,u” in names, fu'ivla, and attitudinal cmavo.
<p><dt><dd>All other vowel pairs simply drop the apostrophe.
</dl><p>The result of these rules is to eliminate the apostrophe altogether, replacing it with comma where necessary, and otherwise with nothing. In addition, names and the cmavo “.i” are capitalized, and irregular stress is marked with an apostrophe (now no longer used for a sound) following the stressed syllable.
<p>
Three points must be emphasized about this alternative orthography:
<p>
<cx "non-standard orthographies, caveat">  XE "non-standard orthographies: caveat"   <dl compact><dt><dd>It is not standard, and has not been used.
<p><dt><dd>It does not represent any changes to the standard Lojban phonology; it is simply a representation of the same phonology using a different written form.
<p><dt><dd>It was designed to aid in a planned rapprochement between the Logical Language Group and The Loglan Institute, a group headed by James Cooke Brown. The rapprochement never took place.
</dl><cx "non-standard orthographies, Cyrillic">  XE "non-standard orthographies: Cyrillic"   There also exists a Cyrillic orthography for Lojban which was designed when the introductory Lojban brochure was translated into Russian. It uses the “à”, “á”, “â”, “ã”, “ä”, “å”, “æ”, “ç”, “è”, “ê”, “ë”, “ì”, “í”, “î”, “ï”, “ð”, “ñ”, “ò”, “ó”, “ô”, “õ”, and “ø” in the obvious ways. The Latin letter “y” is mapped onto the hard sign “ú”, as in Bulgarian. The apostrophe, comma, and period are unchanged. Diphthongs are written as vowel pairs, as in the Roman representation.
<p>
<cx "non-standard orthographies, Tengwar">  XE "non-standard orthographies: Tengwar"   <cx "Tolkien, and non-standard Lojban orthography">  XE "Tolkien: and non-standard Lojban orthography"   Finally, an orthography using the Tengwar of Fé&eacute;anor, a fictional orthography invented by J. R. R. Tolkien and described in the Appendixes to <cite>The Lord Of The Rings</cite>, has been devised for Lojban. The following mapping, which closely resembles that used for Westron, will be meaningful only to those who have read those appendixes. In brief, the tincoté&eacute;ma and parmaté&eacute;ma are used in the conventional ways; the calmaté&eacute;ma represents palatal consonants, and the quesseté&eacute;ma represents velar consonants.
<p>
<pre> 	t	tinco		p	parma
	-	calma		k	quesse

	r	ore		u	vala
	i	anna		-	vilya
</pre><p>The letters “vala” and “anna” are use for “u” and “i” only when those letters are used to represent glides. Of the additional letters, “r”, “l”, “s”, and “z” are written with “ró&oacute;men”, “lambe”, “silme”, and “á&aacute;re/“esse” respectively; the inverted forms are used as free variants.
<p>
<p>
Lojban, like Quenya, is a vowel-last language, so tehtar are read as following the tengwar on which they are placed. The conventional tehtar are used for the five regular vowels, and the dot below for “y”. The Lojban apostrophe is represented by “halla”. There is no equivalent of the Lojban comma or period.

The Shape Of Words To Come: Lojban Morphology</h2>

<p>
<a name=s1><h3>Introductory</h3>
<p>
<cx "morphology, simplicity of">  XE "morphology: simplicity of"   <cx "morphology, definition">  XE "morphology: definition"   <cx "word forms, in Lojban (see also morphology)">  XE "word forms: in Lojban (see also morphology)"   Morphology is the part of grammar that deals with the form of words. Lojban's morphology is fairly simple compared to that of many languages, because Lojban words don't change form depending on how they are used. English has only a small number of such changes compared to languages like Russian, but it does have changes like “boys” as the plural of “boy”, or “walked” as the past-tense form of “walk”. To make plurals or past tenses in Lojban, you add separate words to the sentence that express the number of boys, or the time when the walking was going on.
<p>
<cx "morphology, derivational">  XE "morphology: derivational"   <cx "derivational morphology, definition">  XE "derivational morphology: definition"   <cx "word forms, as related to grammatical uses">  XE "word forms: as related to grammatical uses"   However, Lojban does have what is called “derivational morphology”: the capability of building new words from old words. In addition, the form of words tells us something about their grammatical uses, and sometimes about the means by which they entered the language. Lojban has very orderly rules for the formation of words of various types, both the words that already exist and new words yet to be created by speakers and writers.
<p>
<cx "morphology, conventions for">  XE "morphology: conventions for"   A stream of Lojban sounds can be uniquely broken up into its component words according to specific rules. These so-called “morphology rules” are summarized in this chapter. (However, a detailed algorithm for breaking sounds into words has not yet been fully debugged, and so is not presented in this book.) First, here are some conventions used to talk about groups of Lojban letters, including vowels and consonants.
<p>
<cx "morphology, symbolic conventions for discussing">  XE "morphology: symbolic conventions for discussing"   <cx "“V”, as a symbol for a single vowel">  XE "V: as a symbol for a single vowel"   <cx "“y”, as not a vowel for morphological discussions">  XE "y: considered not to be a vowel for morphological discussions"   <dl compact><dt>1)	<dd>V represents any single Lojban vowel except “y”; that is, it represents “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, or “u”.
</dl><cx "“VV”, as a symbol for a double vowel">  XE "VV string: as a symbol for a double vowel"   <dl compact><dt>2)	<dd>VV represents either a diphthong, one of the following:
<p><dt>	<dd>ai ei oi au
	<p><dt><dd>	or a two-syllable vowel pair with an apostrophe separating the vowels, one of the following:
<p><dt>	<dd>a'a a'e a'i a'o a'u
	e'a e'e e'i e'o e'u
	i'a i'e i'i i'o i'u
	o'a o'e o'i o'o o'u
	u'a u'e u'i u'o u'u
</dl><cx "“C”, as a symbol for a single consonant">  XE "C string: as a symbol for a single consonant"   <cx "syllabic “l”, as a consonant for morphological discussions">  XE "syllabic l: considered as a consonant for morphological discussions"   <cx "syllabic “m”, as a consonant for morphological discussions">  XE "syllabic m: as a consonant for morphological discussions"   <cx "syllabic “n”, as a consonant for morphological discussions">  XE "syllabic n: as a consonant for morphological discussions"   <cx "syllabic “r”, as a consonant for morphological discussions">  XE "syllabic r: as a consonant for morphological discussions"   <cx "apostrophe, as not a consonant for morphological discussions">  XE "apostrophe: as not a consonant for morphological discussions"   <dl compact><dt>3)	<dd>C represents a single Lojban consonant, not including the apostrophe, one of “b”, “c”, “d”, “f”, “g”, “j”, “k”, “l”, “m”, “n”, “p”, “r”, “s”, “t”, “v”, “x”, or “z”. Syllabic “l”, “m”, “n”, and “r” always count as consonants for the purposes of this chapter.

</dl><cx "“CC”, as a symbol for a permissible initial consonant pair">  XE "CC string: as a symbol for a permissible initial consonant pair"   <dl compact><dt>4)	<dd>CC represents two adjacent consonants of type C which constitute one of the 48 permissible initial consonant pairs:
<p><dt>	<dd>bl br
	cf ck cl cm cn cp cr ct
	dj dr dz
	fl fr
	gl gr

	kl kr

	tc tr ts
	vl vr
	xl xr
	zb zd zg zm zv
</dl><cx "“C/C”, as a symbol for a permissible consonant pair">  XE "C/C string: as a symbol for a permissible consonant pair"   <dl compact><dt>5)	<dd>C/C represents two adjacent consonants which constitute one of the permissible consonant pairs (not necessarily a permissible initial consonant pair). The permissible consonant pairs are explained in <a href=chap3.html>Chapter 3</a>. In brief, any consonant pair is permissible unless it: contains two identical letters, contains both a voiced (excluding “r”, “l”, “m”, “n”) and and an unvoiced consonant, or is one of certain specified forbidden pairs.
</dl><cx "“C/CC”, as a symbol for a consonant triple">  XE "C/CC string: as a symbol for a consonant triple"   <dl compact><dt>6)	<dd>C/CC represents a consonant triple. The first two consonants must constitute a permissible consonant pair; the last two consonants must constitute a permissible initial consonant pair.
</dl><cx "word classes">  XE "word classes"   <cx "parts of speech">  XE "parts of speech"   <cx "cmavo, as one of the 3 basic word classes">  XE "cmavo: as one of the 3 basic word classes"   <cx "cmene, as one of the 3 basic word classes">  XE "cmene: as one of the 3 basic word classes"   <cx "brivla, as one of the 3 basic word classes">  XE "brivla: as one of the 3 basic word classes"   Lojban has three basic word classes — parts of speech — in contrast to the eight that are traditional in English. These three classes are called cmavo, brivla, and cmene. Each of these classes has uniquely identifying properties — an arrangement of letters that allows the word to be uniquely and unambiguously recognized as a separate word in a string of Lojban, upon either reading or hearing, and as belonging to a specific word-class.
<p>
They are also functionally different: cmavo are the structure words, corresponding to English words like “and”, “if”, “the” and “to”; brivla are the content words, corresponding to English words like “come”, “red”, “doctor”, and “freely”; cmene are proper names, corresponding to English “James”, “Afghanistan”, and “Pope John Paul II”.
<p>
<a name=s2><h3>cmavo</h3>
<p>
<cx "cmavo, definition">  XE "cmavo: definition"   <cx "selma'o, definition">  XE "selma'o: definition"   <cx "structure words">  XE "structure words"   <cx "articles, cmavo as Lojban equivalents">  XE "articles: cmavo as Lojban equivalents"   <cx "conjunctions, cmavo as Lojban equivalents">  XE "conjunctions: cmavo as Lojban equivalents"   <cx "prepositions, cmavo as Lojban equivalents">  XE "prepositions: cmavo as Lojban equivalents"   <cx "numbers, cmavo as Lojban equivalents">  XE "numbers: cmavo as Lojban equivalents"   <cx "punctuation marks, cmavo as Lojban equivalents">  XE "punctuation marks: cmavo as Lojban equivalents"   The first group of Lojban words discussed in this chapter are the cmavo. They are the structure words that hold the Lojban language together. They often have no semantic meaning in themselves, though they may affect the semantics of brivla to which they are attached. The cmavo include the equivalent of English articles, conjunctions, prepositions, numbers, and punctuation marks. There are over a hundred subcategories of cmavo, known as “selma'o”, each having a specifically defined grammatical usage. The various selma'o are discussed throughout <a href=chap5.html>Chapters 5 </a>to <a href=chap19.html>19 </a>and summarized in <a href=chap20.html>Chapter 20</a>.
<p>
<cx "cmavo, structure of">  XE "cmavo: structure of"   Standard cmavo occur in four forms defined by their word structure. Here are some examples of the various forms:
<p>
<pre> 	V-form		.a	.e	.i	.o	.u
	CV-form	ba	ce	di	fo	gu
	VV-form	.au	.ei	.ia	.o'u	.u'e
	CVV-form	ki'a	pei	mi'o	coi	cu'u
</pre><p>In addition, there is the cmavo “.y.” (remember that “y” is not a V), which must have pauses before and after it.
<p>
<cx "cmavo, simple">  XE "cmavo: simple"   <cx "cmavo, for experimental use">  XE "cmavo: for experimental use"   <cx "experimental cmavo, forms for">  XE "experimental cmavo: forms for"   <cx "cmavo, lack of relation of form to grammatical use">  XE "cmavo: lack of relation of form to grammatical use"   A simple cmavo thus has the property of having only one or two vowels, or of having a single consonant followed by one or two vowels. Words consisting of three or more vowels in a row, or a single consonant followed by three or more vowels, are also of cmavo form, but are reserved for experimental use: a few examples are “ku'a'e”, “sau'e”, and “bai'ai”. All CVV cmavo beginning with the letter “x” are also reserved for experimental use. In general, though, the form of a cmavo tells you little or nothing about its grammatical use.
<p>
<cx "cmavo, experimental">  XE "cmavo: experimental"   <cx "experimental cmavo, definition">  XE "experimental cmavo: definition"   “Experimental use” means that the language designers will not assign any standard meaning or usage to these words, and words and usages coined by Lojban speakers will not appear in official dictionaries for the indefinite future. Experimental-use words provide an escape hatch for adding grammatical mechanisms (as opposed to semantic concepts) the need for which was not foreseen.
<p>
<cx "cmavo, diphthongs in">  XE "cmavo: diphthongs in"   The cmavo of VV-form include not only the diphthongs and vowel pairs listed in <a href=#s1>Section 1</a>, but also the following ten additional diphthongs:
<p>
<pre>		.ia	.ie	.ii	.io	.iu
		.ua	.ue	.ui	.uo	.uu
</pre><p>In addition, cmavo can have the form “Cy”, a consonant followed by the letter “y”. These cmavo represent letters of the Lojban alphabet, and are discussed in detail in <a href=chap17.html>Chapter 17</a>.
<p>
<cx "cmavo, compound">  XE "cmavo: compound"   <cx "compound cmavo, definition">  XE "compound cmavo: definition"   <cx "compound cmavo, compared with sequence of simple cmavo">  XE "compound cmavo: compared with sequence of simple cmavo"   Compound cmavo are sequences of cmavo attached together to form a single written word. A compound cmavo is always identical in meaning and in grammatical use to the separated sequence of simple cmavo from which it is composed. These words are written in compound form merely to save visual space, and to ease the reader's burden in identifying when the component cmavo are acting together.
<p>
<cx "compound cmavo, recognition of">  XE "compound cmavo: recognition of"   Compound cmavo, while not visually short like their components, can be readily identified by two characteristics:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>1)	<dd>They have no consonant pairs or clusters, and
<p><dt>2)	<dd>They end in a vowel.
</dl><p>For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	.iseci'i
	.i se ci'i
<a name=e2d2>2.2)	punaijecanai
	pu nai je ca nai
<a name=e2d3>2.3)	ki'e.u'e
	ki'e .u'e
</pre><cx "pauses, before vowels">  XE "pauses: before vowels"   The cmavo “.u'e” begins with a vowel, and like all words beginning with a vowel, requires a pause (represented by “.”) before it. This pause cannot be omitted simply because the cmavo is incorporated into a compound cmavo. On the other hand,
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d4>2.4)	ki'e'u'e
</pre>is a single cmavo reserved for experimental purposes: it has four vowels.
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d5>2.5)	cy.ibu.abu
	cy. .ibu .abu
</pre><p>Again the pauses are required (see <a href=#s9>Section 9</a>); the pause after “cy.” merges with the pause before “.ibu”.
<p>
<cx "cmavo, stress on">  XE "cmavo: stress on"   <cx "stress, on cmavo">  XE "stress: on cmavo"   There is no particular stress required in cmavo or their compounds. Some conventions do exist that are not mandatory. For two-syllable cmavo, for example, stress is typically placed on the first vowel; an example is
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d6>2.6)	.e'o ko ko kurji
	.E'o ko ko KURji
</pre><p>This convention results in a consistent rhythm to the language, since brivla are required to have penultimate stress; some find this esthetically pleasing.
<p>
<cx "pause, requirement between stressed syllables">  XE "pause: requirement between stressed syllables"   If the final syllable of one word is stressed, and the first syllable of the next word is stressed, you must insert a pause or glottal stop between the two stressed syllables. Thus
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d7>2.7)	le re nanmu
</pre>can be optionally pronounced
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d8>2.8)	le RE. NANmu
</pre>since there are no rules forcing stress on either of the first two words; the stress on “re”, though, demands that a pause separate “re” from the following syllable “nan” to ensure that the stress on “nan” is properly heard as a stressed syllable. The alternative pronunciation
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d9>2.9)	LE re NANmu
</pre>is also valid; this would apply secondary stress (used for purposes of emphasis, contrast or sentence rhythm) to “le”, comparable in rhythmical effect to the English phrase “THE two men”. In <a href=#e2d8>Example 2.8</a>, the secondary stress on “re” would be similar to that in the English phrase “the TWO men”.
<p>
Both cmavo may also be left unstressed, thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d10>2.10)	le re NANmu
</pre><p>This would probably be the most common usage.
<p>
<a name=s3><h3>brivla</h3>
<p>
<cx "brivla, definition">  XE "brivla: definition"   <cx "nouns, brivla as Lojban equivalents">  XE "nouns: brivla as Lojban equivalents"   <cx "adjectives, brivla as Lojban equivalents">  XE "adjectives: brivla as Lojban equivalents"   <cx "verbs, brivla as Lojban equivalents">  XE "verbs: brivla as Lojban equivalents"   <cx "adverbs, brivla as Lojban equivalents">  XE "adverbs: brivla as Lojban equivalents"   Predicate words, called “brivla”, are at the core of Lojban. They carry most of the semantic information in the language. They serve as the equivalent of English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, all in a single part of speech.
<p>
<cx "types and subtypes of words">  XE "types and subtypes of words"   <cx "subtypes of words">  XE "subtypes of words"   Every brivla belongs to one of three major subtypes. These subtypes are defined by the form, or morphology, of the word — all words of a particular structure can be assigned by sight or sound to a particular type (cmavo, brivla, or cmene) and subtype. Knowing the type and subtype then gives you, the reader or listener, significant clues to the meaning and the origin of the word, even if you have never heard the word before.
<p>
<cx "flexible vocabulary">  XE "flexible vocabulary"   The same principle allows you, when speaking or writing, to invent new brivla for new concepts “on the fly”; yet it offers people that you are trying to communicate with a good chance to figure out your meaning. In this way, Lojban has a flexible vocabulary which can be expanded indefinitely.
<p>
<cx "brivla, properties of">  XE "brivla: properties of"   All brivla have the following properties:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>1)	<dd>always end in a vowel;
<p><dt>2)	<dd>always contain a consonant pair in the first five letters, where “y” and apostrophe are not counted as letters for this purpose (See <a href=#s6>Section 6</a>);
<p><dt>3)	<dd>always are stressed on the next-to-the-last (penultimate) syllable; this implies that they have two or more syllables.
</dl><cx "brivla, recognition of">  XE "brivla: recognition of"   <cx "brivla form, contrasted with cmavo form">  XE "brivla form: contrasted with cmavo form"   <cx "brivla form, contrasted with cmene form">  XE "brivla form: contrasted with cmene form"   <cx "cmavo form, contrasted with brivla form">  XE "cmavo form: contrasted with brivla form"   <cx "cmene form, contrasted with brivla form">  XE "cmene form: contrasted with brivla form"   The presence of a consonant pair distinguishes brivla from cmavo and their compounds. The final vowel distinguishes brivla from cmene, which always end in a consonant. Thus “da'amei” must be a compound cmavo because it lacks a consonant pair; “lojban.” must be a name because it lacks a final vowel.
<p>
<cx "brivla, consonant pairs in">  XE "brivla: consonant pairs in"   <cx "consonant pairs, in brivla">  XE "consonant pairs: in brivla"   <cx "“y”, between letters of consonant pair">  XE "y: letter: between letters of consonant pair"   <cx "consonant pairs, “y” within">  XE "consonant pairs: letter y within"   Thus, “bisycla” has the consonant pair “sc” in the first five non-“y” letters even though the “sc” actually appears in the form of “syc”. Similarly, the word “ro'inre'o” contains “nr” in the first five letters because the apostrophes are not counted for this purpose.
<p>
<cx "brivla, subtypes of">  XE "brivla: subtypes of"   The three subtypes of brivla are:
<p>
<cx "primitive roots, gismu as">  XE "primitive roots: gismu as"   <cx "gismu, as a subtype of brivla">  XE "gismu: as a subtype of brivla"   <dl compact><dt>1)	<dd>gismu, the Lojban primitive roots from which all other brivla are built;
</dl><cx "lujvo, as a subtype of brivla">  XE "lujvo: as a subtype of brivla"   <cx "compound of gismu, lujvo as">  XE "compound of gismu: lujvo as"   <dl compact><dt>2)	<dd>lujvo, the compounds of two or more gismu; and
</dl><cx "fu'ivla, as a subtype of brivla">  XE "fu'ivla: as a subtype of brivla"   <cx "borrowing from other language, fu'ivla as">  XE "borrowing from other language: fu'ivla as"   <pre>3)	fu'ivla (literally “copy-word”), the specialized words that are not Lojban primitives or natural compounds, and are therefore borrowed from other languages.
</pre><a name=s4><h3>gismu</h3>
<p>
<cx "gismu, definition">  XE "gismu: definition"   <cx "gismu, rationale for choice of">  XE "gismu: rationale for choice of"   The gismu, or Lojban root words, are those brivla representing concepts most basic to the language. The gismu were chosen for various reasons: some represent concepts that are very familiar and basic; some represent concepts that are frequently used in other languages; some were added because they would be helpful in constructing more complex words; some because they represent fundamental Lojban concepts (like “cmavo” and “gismu” themselves).
<p>
<cx "gismu, selection of">  XE "gismu: selection of"   <cx "gismu, as partitioning semantic space">  XE "gismu: as partitioning semantic space"   The gismu do not represent any sort of systematic partitioning of semantic space. Some gismu may be superfluous, or appear for historical reasons: the gismu list was being collected for almost 35 years and was only weeded out once. Instead, the intention is that the gismu blanket semantic space: they make it possible to talk about the entire range of human concerns.
<p>
<cx "gismu and cmavo, major">  XE “gismu: and cmavo, major"   <cx "cmavo and gismu, major">  XE "cmavo and gismu: major"   <cx "learning Lojban, magnitude of task">  XE "learning Lojban: magnitude of task"   There are about 1350 gismu. In learning Lojban, you need only to learn most of these gismu and their combining forms (known as “rafsi”) as well as perhaps 200 major cmavo, and you will be able to communicate effectively in the language. This may sound like a lot, but it is a small number compared to the vocabulary needed for similar communications in other languages.
<p>
<cx "gismu, rules for">  XE "gismu: rules for"   All gismu have very strong form restrictions. Using the conventions defined in <a href=#s1>Section 1</a>, all gismu are of the forms CVC/CV or CCVCV. They must meet the rules for all brivla given in <a href=#s3>Section 3</a>; furthermore, they:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>1)	<dd>always have five letters;
<p><dt>2)	<dd>always start with a consonant and end with a single vowel;
<p><dt>3)	<dd>always contain exactly one consonant pair, which is a permissible initial pair (CC) if it's at the beginning of the gismu, but otherwise only has to be a permissible pair (C/C);
<p><dt>4)	<dd>are always stressed on the first syllable (since that is penultimate).
</dl><cx "gismu, length of">  XE "gismu: length of"   The five letter length distinguishes gismu from lujvo and fu'ivla. (It is possible to have fu'ivla like “spa'i” that are five letters long, but they must have “ ' ”; no gismu contains “ ' ”.)
<p>
<cx "gismu, special">  XE "gismu: special"   <cx "gismu, conflicts between">  XE "gismu: conflicts between"   With the exception of five special brivla variables, “broda”, “brode”, “brodi”, “brodo”, and “brodu”, no two gismu differ only in the final vowel. Furthermore, the set of gismu was specifically designed to reduce the likelihood that two similar sounding gismu could be confused. For example, because “gismu” is in the set of gismu, “kismu”, “xismu”, “gicmu”, “gizmu”, and “gisnu” cannot be.
<p>
<cx "gismu, source of">  XE "gismu: source of"   Almost all Lojban gismu are constructed from pieces of words drawn from other languages, specifically Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic, the six most widely spoken natural languages. For a given concept, words in the six languages that represent that concept were written in Lojban phonetics. Then a gismu was selected to maximize the recognizability of the Lojban word for speakers of the six languages by weighting the inclusion of the sounds drawn from each language by the number of speakers of that language. See <a href=#s14>Section 14 </a>for a full explanation of the algorithm.
<p>
<cx "gismu, examples of">  XE "gismu: examples of"   Here are a few examples of gismu, with rough English equivalents (not definitions):

Lojban tanru are an elaboration of the concept of “metaphor” used in English. In Lojban, any brivla can be used to modify another brivla. The first of the pair modifies the second. This modification is usually restrictive — the modifying brivla reduces the broader sense of the modified brivla to form a more narrow, concrete, or specific concept. Modifying brivla may thus be seen as acting like English adverbs or adjectives. For example,
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	skami pilno
</pre>is the tanru which expresses the concept of “computer user”.
<p>
<cx "tanru, combination of">  XE "tanru: combination of"   The simplest Lojban tanru are pairings of two concepts or ideas. Such tanru take two simpler ideas that can be represented by gismu and combine them into a single more complex idea. Two-part tanru may then be recombined in pairs with other tanru, or with individual gismu, to form more complex or more specific ideas, and so on.
<p>
<cx "tanru, ambiguity of">  XE "tanru: ambiguity of"   The meaning of a tanru is usually at least partly ambiguous: “skami pilno” could refer to a computer that is a user, or to a user of computers. There are a variety of ways that the modifier component can be related to the modified component. It is also possible to use cmavo within tanru to provide variations (or to prevent ambiguities) of meaning.
<p>
<cx "tanru, and creativity">  XE "tanru: and creativity"   Making tanru is essentially a poetic or creative act, not a science. While the syntax expressing the grouping relationships within tanru is unambiguous, tanru are still semantically ambiguous, since the rules defining the relationships between the gismu are flexible. The process of devising a new tanru is dealt with in detail in <a href=chap5.html>Chapter 5</a>.

</pre>representing roughly the same concept as the English word “ship”.
<p>
<ex "paternal grandmother">  XE "paternal grandmother: example“  The binary metaphor “father mother” can refer to a paternal grandmother (“a father-ly type of mother”), while “mother father” can refer to a maternal grandfather (“a mother-ly type of father”). In Lojban, these become the tanru

<pre><a name=e5d3>5.3)	patfu mamta
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d4>5.4)	mamta patfu
</pre>respectively.
<p>
<cx "tanru, ambiguity in">  XE "tanru: ambiguity in"   The possibility of semantic ambiguity can easily be seen in the last case. To interpret <a href=#e5d4>Example 5.4</a>, the listener must determine what type of motherliness pertains to the father being referred to. In an appropriate context, “mamta patfu” could mean not “grandfather” but simply “father with some motherly attributes”, depending on the culture. If absolute clarity is required, there are ways to expand upon and explain the exact interrelationship between the components; but such detail is usually not needed.

For <a href=#e5d1>Example 5.1</a>, we would probably choose “user of computers”, and form the new word
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d5>5.5)	sampli

</pre><cx "lujvo, unambiguous decomposition of">  XE "lujvo: unambiguous decomposition of"   <cx "rafsi, definition">  XE "rafsi: definition"   <cx "lujvo, construction of">  XE "lujvo: construction of"   The lujvo representing a given tanru is built from units representing the component gismu. These units are called “rafsi” in Lojban. Each rafsi represents only one gismu. The rafsi are attached together in the order of the words in the tanru, occasionally inserting so-called “hyphen” letters to ensure that the pieces stick together as a single word and cannot accidentally be broken apart into cmavo, gismu, or other word forms. As a result, each lujvo can be readily and accurately recognized, allowing a listener to pick out the word from a string of spoken Lojban, and if necessary, unambiguously decompose the word to a unique source tanru, thus providing a strong clue to its meaning.
<p>
The lujvo that can be built from the tanru “mamta patfu” in <a href=#e5d4>Example 5.4 </a>is
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d7>5.7)	mampa'u
</pre>which refers specifically to the concept “maternal grandfather”. The two gismu that constitute the tanru are represented in “mampa'u” by the rafsi “mam-” and “-pa'u”, respectively; these two rafsi are then concatenated together to form “mampa'u”.

When a lujvo is formally entered into a dictionary of the language, a specific definition will be assigned based on one particular interrelationship between the terms. (See <a href=chap12.html>Chapter 12 </a>for how this has been done.) Unlike gismu, lujvo may have more than one form. This is because there is no difference in meaning between the various rafsi for a gismu when they are used to build a lujvo. A long rafsi may be used, especially in noisy environments, in place of a short rafsi; the result is considered the same lujvo, even though the word is spelled and pronounced differently. Thus the word “brivla”, built from the tanru “bridi valsi”, is the same lujvo as “brivalsi”, “bridyvla”, and “bridyvalsi”, each of which uses a different combination of rafsi.

There are specific rules describing these conditions, detailed in <a href=#s6>Section 6</a>.

For example, in the lujvo

Without the “r”, the word would break up into “soi sai”, two cmavo. The pair of cmavo have no relation to their rafsi lookalikes; they will either be ungrammatical (as in this case), or will express a different meaning from what was intended.
<p>
Learning rafsi and the rules for assembling them into lujvo is clearly seen to be necessary for fully using the potential Lojban vocabulary.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, invention of">  XE "lujvo: invention of"   Most important, it is possible to invent new lujvo while you speak or write in order to represent a new or unfamiliar concept, one for which you do not know any existing Lojban word. As long as you follow the rules for building these compounds, there is a good chance that you will be understood without explanation.

It is valid to use any of the rafsi forms in building lujvo — whichever the reader or listener will most easily understand, or whichever is most pleasing — subject to the rules of lujvo making. There is a scoring algorithm which is intended to determine which of the possible and legal lujvo forms will be the standard dictionary form (see <a href=#s12>Section 12</a>).

These forms are represented as CVC/CV or CCVCV (called “the 5-letter rafsi”), and CVC/C or CCVC (called “the 4-letter rafsi”) respectively. The dashes in these rafsi form representations show where other rafsi may be attached to form a valid lujvo. When lujvo are formed only from 4-letter and 5-letter rafsi, known collectively as “long rafsi”, they are called “unreduced lujvo”.
<p>
Some examples of unreduced lujvo forms are:

	from “mamta patfu”
	“mother father” or “maternal grandfather”

	“letter list” or a “list of letters”
	(letters of the alphabet)

	from “nanca prali”
	“year profit” or “annual profit”
<a name=e6d4>6.4)	prunyplipe

	“elastic (springy) leap” or “spring” (the verb)
</pre><ex "supper">  XE "supper: example“  <pre><a name=e6d5>6.5)	vancysanmi
	from “vanci sanmi”
	“evening meal” or “supper”
</pre><cx "rafsi, short">  XE "rafsi: short"   <cx "short rafsi">  XE "short rafsi"   In addition to these two forms, each gismu may have up to three additional short rafsi, three letters long. All short rafsi have one of the forms CVC, CCV, or CVV. The total number of rafsi forms that are assigned to a gismu depends on how useful the gismu is, or is presumed to be, in making lujvo, when compared to other gismu that could be assigned the rafsi.
<p>
<cx "comparatives, use of zmadu in forming">  XE "comparatives: use of zmadu in forming"   <cx "-er, use of zmadu in forming">  XE "-er: use of zmadu in forming"   For example, “zmadu” (“more than”) has the two short rafsi “zma” and “mau” (in addition to its unreduced rafsi “zmad” and “zmadu”), because a vast number of lujvo have been created based on “zmadu”, corresponding in general to English comparative adjectives ending in “-er” such as “whiter” (Lojban “labmau”). On the other hand, “bakri” (“chalk”) has no short rafsi and few lujvo.
<p>
There are at most one CVC-form, one CCV-form, and one CVV-form rafsi per gismu. In fact, only a tiny handful of gismu have both a CCV-form and a CVV-form rafsi assigned, and still fewer have all three forms of short rafsi. However, gismu with both a CVC-form and another short rafsi are fairly common, partly because more possible CVC-form rafsi exist. Yet CVC-form rafsi, even though they are fairly easy to remember, cannot be used at the end of a lujvo (because lujvo must end in vowels), so justifying the assignment of an additional short rafsi to many gismu.
<p>
<cx "rafsi space">  XE "rafsi space"   <cx "rafsi, rationale for assignments of">  XE "rafsi: rationale for assignments of"   The intention was to use the available “rafsi space” — the set of all possible short rafsi forms — in the most efficient way possible; the goal is to make the most-used lujvo as short as possible (thus maximizing the use of short rafsi), while keeping the rafsi very recognizable to anyone who knows the source gismu. For this reason, the letters in a rafsi have always been chosen from among the five letters of the corresponding gismu. As a result, there are a limited set of short rafsi available for assignment to each gismu. At most seven possible short rafsi are available for consideration (of which at most three can be used, as explained above).
<p>
<cx "rafsi, possible forms for construction of">  XE "rafsi: possible forms for construction of"   Here are the only short rafsi forms that can possibly exist for gismu of the form CVC/CV, like “sakli”. The digits in the second column represent the gismu letters used to form the rafsi.

</pre><cx "rafsi assignments, non-reassignability of">  XE "rafsi assignments: non-reassignability of"   (In fact, “blaci” has none of these short rafsi; they are all assigned to other gismu. Lojban speakers are not free to reassign any of the rafsi; the tables shown here are to help understand how the rafsi were chosen in the first place.)
<p>
<cx "rafsi, considerations restricting construction of">  XE "rafsi: considerations restricting construction of"   There are a few restrictions: a CVV-form rafsi without an apostrophe cannot exist unless the vowels make up one of the four diphthongs “ai”, “ei”, “oi”, or “au”; and a CCV-form rafsi is possible only if the two consonants form a permissible initial consonant pair (see <a href=#s1>Section 1</a>). Thus “mamta”, which has the same form as “salci”, can only have “mam”, “mat”, and “ma'a” as possible rafsi: in fact, only “mam” is assigned to it.
<p>
<cx "rafsi for numbers">  XE "rafsi for numbers"   <cx "numbers, rafsi for">  XE "numbers: rafsi for"   Some cmavo also have associated rafsi, usually CVC-form. For example, the ten common numerical digits, which are all CV form cmavo, each have a CVC-form rafsi formed by adding a consonant to the cmavo. Most cmavo that have rafsi are ones used in composing tanru (for a complete list, see <a href=chap12.html>Chapter 12</a>).
<p>
<cx "lujvo, fully reduced">  XE "lujvo: fully reduced"   <cx "fully reduced lujvo, definition">  XE "fully reduced lujvo: definition"   The term for a lujvo made up solely of short rafsi is “fully reduced lujvo”. Here are some examples of fully reduced lujvo:

As a brivla, a lujvo must also contain a consonant cluster within the first five letters — this ensures that they cannot be mistaken for compound cmavo. Of course, all lujvo have at least six letters since they have two or more rafsi, each at least three letters long; hence they cannot be confused with gismu.
<p>
<cx "hyphens, use of">  XE "hyphens: use of"   <cx "hyphen letter, definition">  XE "hyphen letter: definition"   <cx "lujvo form, requirements for hyphen insertion in">  XE "lujvo form: requirements for hyphen insertion in"   When attaching two rafsi together, it may be necessary to insert a hyphen letter. In Lojban, the term “hyphen” always refers to a letter, either the vowel “y” or one of the consonants “r” and “n”. (The letter “l” can also be a hyphen, but is not used as one in lujvo.)
<p>
<cx "lujvo form, requirements for “y”-hyphen insertion in">  XE "lujvo form: requirements for y-hyphen insertion in"   The “y”-hyphen is used after a CVC-form rafsi when joining it with the following rafsi could result in an impermissible consonant pair, or when the resulting lujvo could fall apart into two or more words (either cmavo or gismu).
<p>
<cx "lujvo, and consonant pairs">  XE "lujvo: and consonant pairs"   Thus, the tanru “pante tavla” (“protest talk”) cannot produce the lujvo “patta'a”, because “tt” is not a permissible consonant pair; the lujvo must be “patyta'a”. Similarly, the tanru “mudri siclu” (“wooden whistle”) cannot form the lujvo “mudsiclu”; instead, “mudysiclu” must be used. (Remember that “y” is not counted in determining whether the first five letters of a brivla contain a consonant cluster: this is why.)
<p>
<cx "rafsi, four-letter, requirement for “y”-hyphen">  XE "rafsi: four-letter, requirement for y-hyphen"   The “y”-hyphen is also used to attach a 4-letter rafsi, formed by dropping the final vowel of a gismu, to the following rafsi. (This procedure was shown, but not explained, in <a href=#e6d{1}>Examples 6.1 </a>to <a href=#e6d5>6.5</a>.)
The lujvo forms “zunlyjamfu”, “zunlyjma”, “zuljamfu”, and “zuljma” are all legitimate and equivalent forms made from the tanru “zunle jamfu” (“left foot”). Of these, “zuljma” is the preferred one since it is the shortest; it thus is likely to be the form listed in a Lojban dictionary.
<p>
<cx "“r”-hyphen, use of">  XE "r-hyphen: use of"   <cx "lujvo form, requirements for “r”-hyphen insertion in">  XE "lujvo form: requirements for r-hyphen insertion in"   <cx "lujvo form, requirements for “n”-hyphen insertion in">  XE "lujvo form: requirements for n-hyphen insertion in"   The “r”-hyphen and its close relative, the “n”-hyphen, are used in lujvo only after CVV-form rafsi. A hyphen is always required in a two-part lujvo of the form CVV-CVV, since otherwise there would be no consonant cluster.
<p>
An “r-”hyphen or “n”-hyphen is also required after the CVV-form rafsi of any lujvo of the form CVV-CVC/CV or CVV-CCVCV since it would otherwise fall apart into a CVV-form cmavo and a gismu. In any lujvo with more than two parts, a CVV-form rafsi in the initial position must always be followed by a hyphen. If the hyphen were to be omitted, the supposed lujvo could be broken into smaller words without the hyphen: because the CVV-form rafsi would be interpreted as a cmavo, and the remainder of the word as a valid lujvo that is one rafsi shorter.
<p>
<cx "“n”-hyphen, use of">  XE "n-hyphen: use of"   <cx "“n”-hyphen, contrasted with “r”-hyphen in requirements for use">  XE "n-hyphen: contrasted with r-hyphen in requirements for use"   <cx "“r”-hyphen, contrasted with “n”-hyphen in requirements for use">  XE "r-hyphen: contrasted with n-hyphen in requirements for use"   An “n”-hyphen is only used in place of an “r”-hyphen when the following rafsi begins with “r”. For example, the tanru “rokci renro” (“rock throw”) cannot be expressed as “ro'ire'o” (which breaks up into two cmavo), nor can it be “ro'irre'o” (which has an impermissible double consonant); the “n”-hyphen is required, and the correct form of the hyphenated lujvo is “ro'inre'o”. The same lujvo could also be expressed without hyphenation as “rokre'o”.
<p>
<lx "zei">  XE "zei"   <lx "ZEI">  XE "ZEI selma’o"   <cx "lujvo, with zei">  XE "lujvo: with zei"   There is also a different way of building lujvo, or rather phrases which are grammatically and semantically equivalent to lujvo. You can make a phrase containing any desired words, joining each pair of them with the special cmavo “zei”. Thus,

</pre><a href=#e6d15>Example 6.15  is particularly noteworthy because the phrase that would be produced by removing the “zei”s from it doesn't end with a brivla, and in fact is not even grammatical. As written, the example is a tanru with two components, but by adding a “zei” between “by.” and “livgyterbilma” to produce

These words are in effect names for concepts, and the names were invented by speakers of another language. The vast majority of words referring to plants, animals, foods, and scientific terminology cannot be easily expressed as tanru. They thus must be borrowed (actually “copied”) into Lojban from the original language.

<cx "fu'ivla, construction of">  XE "fu'ivla: construction of"   <cx "fu'ivla, form of">  XE "fu'ivla: form of"   The form of a fu'ivla reliably distinguishes it from both the gismu and the cmavo. Like cultural gismu, fu'ivla are generally based on a word from a single non-Lojban language. The word is “borrowed” (actually “copied”, hence the Lojban tanru “fukpi valsi”) from the other language and Lojbanized — the phonemes are converted to their closest Lojban equivalent and modifications are made as necessary to make the word a legitimate Lojban fu'ivla-form word. All fu'ivla:

Stage 3 fu'ivla can be made easily on the fly, as lujvo can, because the procedure for forming them always guarantees a word that cannot violate any of the rules. Stage 4 fu'ivla require running tests that are not simple to characterize or perform, and should be made only after deliberation and by someone knowledgeable about all the considerations that apply.
<p>
<cx "fu'ivla, algorithm for constructing">  XE "fu'ivla: algorithm for constructing"   Here is a simple and reliable procedure for making a non-Lojban word into a valid Stage 3 fu'ivla:

It is only safe to use a 4-letter rafsi; short rafsi sometimes produce invalid fu'ivla.

Here are a few examples:
<p>
<ex "spaghetti">  XE "spaghetti: example“   <pre><a name=e7d3>7.3)	spaghetti (from English or Italian)
	spageti (Lojbanize)
	cidj,r,spageti (prefix long rafsi)
	dja,r,spageti (prefix short rafsi)
</pre>where “cidj-” is the 4-letter rafsi for “cidja”, the Lojban gismu for “food”, thus categorizing “cidjrspageti” as a kind of food. The form with the short rafsi happens to work, but such good fortune cannot be relied on: in any event, it means the same thing.
<p>
<ex "maple trees">  XE "maple trees: example“  <ex "Acer">  XE "Acer: example“  <pre><a name=e7d4>7.4)	Acer (the scientific name of maple trees)
	acer (Lojbanize)

	ric,r,xaceru (prefix short rafsi)
</pre><ex "maple sugar">  XE "maple sugar: example“  where “tric-” and “ric-” are rafsi for “tricu”, the gismu for “tree”. Note that by the same principles, “maple sugar” could get the fu'ivla “saktrxaceru”, or could be represented by the tanru “tricrxaceru sakta”. Technically, “ricrxaceru” and “tricrxaceru” are distinct fu'ivla, but they would surely be given the same meanings if both happened to be in use.
<p>

<cx "fu'ivla, disambiguation of">  XE "fu'ivla: disambiguation of"   <cx "fu'ivla categorizer, for distinguishing fu'ivla form">  XE "fu'ivla categorizer: for distinguishing fu'ivla form"   The use of the prefix helps distinguish among the many possible meanings of the borrowed word, depending on the field. As it happens, “spageti” and “kuarka” are valid Stage 4 fu'ivla, but “xaceru” looks like a compound cmavo, and “kobra” like a gismu.
<p>
<cx "fu'ivla categorizer, for distinguishing specialized meanings">  XE "fu'ivla categorizer: for distinguishing specialized meanings"   For another example, “integral” has a specific meaning to a mathematician. But the Lojban fu'ivla “integrale”, which is a valid Stage 4 fu'ivla, does not convey that mathematical sense to a non-mathematical listener, even one with an English-speaking background; its source — the English word “integral” — has various other specialized meanings in other fields.
<p>
Left uncontrolled, “integrale” almost certainly would eventually come to mean the same collection of loosely related concepts that English associates with “integral”, with only the context to indicate (possibly) that the mathematical term is meant.
<p>
<ex "integral, mathematical concept">  XE "integral: mathematical concept, example“  <ex "integral, architectural concept">  XE "integral: architectural concept, example“  The prefix method would render the mathematical concept as “cmacrntegrale”, if the “i” of “integrale” is removed, or something like “cmacrnintegrale”, if a new consonant is added to the beginning; “cmac-” is the rafsi for “cmaci” (“mathematics”). The architectural sense of “integral” might be conveyed with “djinrnintegrale” or “tarmrnintegrale”, where “dinju” and “tarmi” mean “building” and “form” respectively.

Arguably, some form of the native name “Chosen” should have been used instead of the internationally known “Korea”; this is a recurring problem in all borrowings. In general, it is better to use the native name unless using it will severely impede understanding: “Navajo” is far more widely known than “Dine'e”.

The requirement that the Lojban speech stream be unambiguously analyzable, however, means that most names must be modified somewhat when they are Lojbanized. Here are a few examples of English names and possible Lojban equivalents:

They are penultimately stressed, unless unusual stress is marked with capitalization. A name may have multiple parts, each ending with a consonant and pause, or the parts may be combined into a single word with no pause. For example,

<p>
<cx "cmene, authority for">  XE "cmene: authority for"   <cx "names, authority for">  XE "names: authority for"   The final arbiter of the correct form of a name is the person doing the naming, although most cultures grant people the right to determine how they want their own name to be spelled and pronounced. The English name “Mary” can thus be Lojbanized as “meris.”, “maris.”, “meiris.”, “merix.”, or even “marys.”. The last alternative is not pronounced much like its English equivalent, but may be desirable to someone who values spelling over pronunciation. The final consonant need not be an “s”; there must, however, be some Lojban consonant at the end.
<p>
<cx "cmene, restrictions on form of">  XE "cmene: restrictions on form of"   <cx "names, restrictions on form of">  XE "names: restrictions on form of"   Names are not permitted to have the sequences “la”, “lai”, or “doi” embedded in them, unless the sequence is immediately preceded by a consonant. These minor restrictions are due to the fact that all Lojban cmene embedded in a speech stream will be preceded by one of these words or by a pause. With one of these words embedded, the cmene might break up into valid Lojban words followed by a shorter cmene. However, break-up cannot happen after a consonant, because that would imply that the word before the “la”, or whatever, ended in a consonant without pause, which is impossible.
<p>
<ex "Laplace">  XE "Laplace: example“  <ex "Nederlands">  XE "Nederlands: example“  For example, the invalid name “laplas.” would look like the Lojban words “la plas.”, and “ilanas.” would be misunderstood as “.i la nas.”. However, “NEderlants.” cannot be misheard as “NEder lants.”, because “NEder” with no following pause is not a possible Lojban word.
<p>
<cx "cmene, alternatives for restricted sequences in">  XE "cmene: alternatives for restricted sequences in"   <cx "names, alternatives for restricted sequences in">  XE "names: alternatives for restricted sequences in"   There are close alternatives to these forbidden sequences that can be used in Lojbanizing names, such as “ly”, “lei”, and “dai” or “do'i”, that do not cause these problems.

</dl><cx "Linnaean names, rules for">  XE "Linnaean names: rules for"   <cx "scientific names, rules for">  XE "scientific names: rules for"   There are some additional rules for Lojbanizing the scientific names (technically known as “Linnaean binomials” after their inventor) which are internationally applied to each species of animal or plant. Where precision is essential, these names need not be Lojbanized, but can be directly inserted into Lojban text using the cmavo “la'o”, explained in <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19</a>. Using this cmavo makes the already lengthy Latinized names at least four syllables longer, however, and leaves the pronunciation in doubt. The following suggestions, though incomplete, will assist in converting Linnaean binomals to valid Lojban names. They can also help to create fu'ivla based on Linnaean binomials or other words of the international scientific vocabulary. The term “back vowel” in the following list refers to any of the letters “a”, “o”, or “u”; the term “front vowel” correspondingly refers to any of the letters “e”, “i”, or “y”.

</dl><a name=s10><h3>Considerations for making lujvo</h3>
<p>
Given a tanru which expresses an idea to be used frequently, it can be turned into a lujvo by following the lujvo-making algorithm which is given in <a href=#s11>Section 11</a>.
<p>
In building a lujvo, the first step is to replace each gismu with a rafsi that uniquely represents that gismu. These rafsi are then attached together by fixed rules that allow the resulting compound to be recognized as a single word and to be analyzed in only one way.
<p>
There are three other complications; only one is serious.
<p>
<cx "rafsi, multiple for each gismu">  XE "rafsi: multiple for each gismu"   The first is that there is usually more than one rafsi that can be used for each gismu. The one to be used is simply whichever one sounds or looks best to the speaker or writer. There are usually many valid combinations of possible rafsi. They all are equally valid, and all of them mean exactly the same thing. (The scoring algorithm given in <a href=#s12>Section 12 </a>is used to choose the standard form of the lujvo — the version which would be entered into a dictionary.)
<p>
<cx "lujvo, unambiguity of">  XE "lujvo: unambiguity of"   <cx "lujvo, consideration in choosing meaning for">  XE "lujvo: consideration in choosing meaning for"   <cx "linguistic drift in Lojban, possible source of">  XE "linguistic drift in Lojban: possible source of"   The second complication is the serious one. Remember that a tanru is ambiguous — it has several possible meanings. A lujvo, or at least one that would be put into the dictionary, has just a single meaning. Like a gismu, a lujvo is a predicate which encompasses one area of the semantic universe, with one set of places. Hopefully the meaning chosen is the most useful of the possible semantic spaces. A possible source of linguistic drift in Lojban is that as Lojbanic society evolves, the concept that seems the most useful one may change.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, meaning drift of">  XE "lujvo: meaning drift of"   <lx "za'e">  XE "za'e"   <cx "za'e, use to avoid lujvo misunderstandings">  XE "za'e: use to avoid lujvo misunderstandings"   You must also be aware of the possibility of some prior meaning of a new lujvo, especially if you are writing for posterity. If a lujvo is invented which involves the same tanru as one that is in the dictionary, and is assigned a different meaning (or even just a different place structure), linguistic drift results. This isn't necessarily bad. Every natural language does it. But in communication, when you use a meaning different from the dictionary definition, someone else may use the dictionary and therefore misunderstand you. You can use the cmavo “za'e” (explained in <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19</a>) before a newly coined lujvo to indicate that it may have a non-dictionary meaning.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, ultimate guideline for choice of meaning/place-structure">  XE "lujvo: ultimate guideline for choice of meaning/place-structure"   The essential nature of human communication is that if the listener understands, then all is well. Let this be the ultimate guideline for choosing meanings and place structures for invented lujvo.
<p>
<cx "Zipf's Law">  XE "Zipf's Law"   <cx "lujvo, dropping elements of">  XE "lujvo: dropping elements of"   The third complication is also simple, but tends to scare new Lojbanists with its implications. It is based on Zipf's Law, which says that the length of words is inversely proportional to their usage. The shortest words are those which are used more; the longest ones are used less. Conversely, commonly used concepts will be tend to be abbreviated. In English, we have abbreviations and acronyms and jargon, all of which represent complex ideas that are used often by small groups of people, so they shortened them to convey more information more rapidly.
<p>
Therefore, given a complicated tanru with grouping markers, abstraction markers, and other cmavo in it to make it syntactically unambiguous, the psychological basis of Zipf's Law may compel the lujvo-maker to drop some of the cmavo to make a shorter (technically incorrect) tanru, and then use that tanru to make the lujvo.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, based on multiple tanru">  XE "lujvo: based on multiple tanru"   This doesn't lead to ambiguity, as it might seem to. A given lujvo still has exactly one meaning and place structure. It is just that more than one tanru is competing for the same lujvo. But more than one meaning for the tanru was already competing for the “right” to define the meaning of the lujvo. Someone has to use judgment in deciding which one meaning is to be chosen over the others.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, considerations for retaining elements of">  XE "lujvo: considerations for retaining elements of"   <cx "lujvo, shorter for more general concepts">  XE "lujvo: shorter for more general concepts"   If the lujvo made by a shorter form of tanru is in use, or is likely to be useful for another meaning, the decider then retains one or more of the cmavo, preferably ones that set this meaning apart from the shorter form meaning that is used or anticipated. As a rule, therefore, the shorter lujvo will be used for a more general concept, possibly even instead of a more frequent word. If both words are needed, the simpler one should be shorter. It is easier to add a cmavo to clarify the meaning of the more complex term than it is to find a good alternate tanru for the simpler term.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, and the listener">  XE "lujvo: and the listener"   <cx "lujvo, and plausibility">  XE "lujvo: and plausibility"   And of course, we have to consider the listener. On hearing an unknown word, the listener will decompose it and get a tanru that makes no sense or the wrong sense for the context. If the listener realizes that the grouping operators may have been dropped out, he or she may try alternate groupings, or try inserting an abstraction operator if that seems plausible. (The grouping of tanru is explained in <a href=chap5.html>Chapter 5</a>; abstraction is explained in <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11</a>.)  Plausibility is the key to learning new ideas and to evaluating unfamiliar lujvo.
<p>
<a name=s11><h3>The lujvo-making algorithm</h3>
<p>
<cx "lujvo, algorithm for">  XE "lujvo: algorithm for"   The following is the current algorithm for generating Lojban lujvo given a known tanru and a complete list of gismu and their assigned rafsi. The algorithm was designed by Bob LeChevalier and Dr. James Cooke Brown for computer program implementation. It was modified in 1989 with the assistance of Nora LeChevalier, who detected a flaw in the original “tosmabru test”.
<p>
Given a tanru that is to be made into a lujvo:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>1)	<dd>Choose a 3-letter or 4-letter rafsi for each of the gismu and cmavo in the tanru except the last.
<p><dt>2)	<dd>Choose a 3-letter (CVV-form or CCV-form) or 5-letter rafsi for the final gismu in the tanru.
<p><dt>3)	<dd>Join the resulting string of rafsi, initially without hyphens.
</dl><cx "hyphens in lujvo, proscribed where not required">  XE "hyphens in lujvo: proscribed where not required"   <dl compact><dt>4)	<dd>Add hyphen letters where necessary. It is illegal to add a hyphen at a place that is not required by this algorithm. Right-to-left tests are recommended, for reasons discussed below.

<p><dt>4a)	<dd>If there are more than two words in the tanru, put an “r”-hyphen (or an “n”-hyphen) after the first rafsi if it is CVV-form. If there are exactly two words, then put an “r”-hyphen (or an “n”-hyphen) between the two rafsi if the first rafsi is CVV-form, unless the second rafsi is CCV-form (for example, “saicli” requires no hyphen). Use an “r”-hyphen unless the letter after the hyphen is “r”, in which case use an “n”-hyphen. Never use an “n”-hyphen unless it is required.
<p><dt>4b)	<dd>Put a “y”-hyphen between the consonants of any impermissible consonant pair. This will always appear between rafsi.
<p><dt>4c)	<dd>Put a “y”-hyphen after any 4-letter rafsi form.
</dl><cx "tosmabru test">  XE "tosmabru test"   <dl compact><dt>5)	<dd>Test all forms with one or more initial CVC-form rafsi — with the pattern “CVC <dots>…</dots>CVC + X” — for “tosmabru failure”. X must either be a CVCCV long rafsi that happens to have a permissible initial pair as the consonant cluster, or is something which has caused a “y”-hyphen to be installed between the previous CVC and itself by one of the above rules.
		The test is as follows:
<p><dt>5a)	<dd>Examine all the C/C consonant pairs that join the CVC rafsi, and also the pair between the last CVC and the X portion, ignoring any “y”-hyphen before the X.
	These consonant pairs are called “joints”.
<p><dt>5b)	<dd>If all of those joints are permissible initials, then the trial word will break up into a cmavo and a shorter brivla. If not, the word will not break up, and no further hyphens are needed.
<p><dt>5c)	<dd>Install a “y”-hyphen at the first such joint.
</dl><p>Note that the “tosmabru test” implies that the algorithm will be more efficient if rafsi junctures are tested for required hyphens from right to left, instead of from left to right; when the test is required, it cannot be completed until hyphenation to the right has been determined.
<p>
<a name=s12><h3>The lujvo scoring algorithm</h3>
<p>
<cx "lujvo, scoring of">  XE "lujvo: scoring of"   <cx "lujvo, selection of best form of">  XE "lujvo: selection of best form of"   This algorithm was devised by Bob and Nora LeChevalier in 1989. It is not the only possible algorithm, but it usually gives a choice that people find preferable. The algorithm may be changed in the future. The lowest-scoring variant will usually be the dictionary form of the lujvo. (In previous versions, it was the highest-scoring variant.)
<p>
<dl compact><dt>1)	<dd>Count the total number of letters, including hyphens and apostrophes; call it “L”.
<p><dt>2)	<dd>Count the number of apostrophes; call it “A”.
<p><dt>3)	<dd>Count the number of “y”-, “r”-, and “n”-hyphens; call it “H”.

<p><dt>4)	<dd>For each rafsi, find the value in the following table. Sum this value over all rafsi; call it “R”:
<p><dt>	<dd>CVC/CV (final)	(-sarji)	1
	CVC/C		(-sarj-)	2
	CCVCV (final)	(-zbasu)	3
	CCVC		(-zbas-)	4
	CVC		(-nun-)	5
	CVV with an apostrophe	(-ta'u-)	6
	CCV		(-zba-)	7
	CVV with no apostrophe	(-sai-)	8
<p><dt>5)	<dd>Count the number of vowels, not including “y”; call it “V”.
		</dl><p>The score is then:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>		<dd>(1000 * L) - (500 * A) + (100 * H) - (10 * R) - V
</dl><cx "hierarchy of priorities for selecting lujvo form">  XE "hierarchy of priorities for selecting lujvo form"   <cx "lujvo form, hierarchy of priorities for selection of">  XE "lujvo form: hierarchy of priorities for selection of"   In case of ties, there is no preference. This should be rare. Note that the algorithm essentially encodes a hierarchy of priorities: short words are preferred (counting apostrophes as half a letter), then words with fewer hyphens, words with more pleasing rafsi (this judgment is subjective), and finally words with more vowels are chosen. Each decision principle is applied in turn if the ones before it have failed to choose; it is possible that a lower-ranked principle might dominate a higher-ranked one if it is ten times better than the alternative.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, scored examples of">  XE "lujvo: scored examples of"   Here are some lujvo with their scores (not necessarily the lowest scoring forms for these lujvo, nor even necessarily sensible lujvo):

</pre><a name=s13><h3>lujvo-making examples</h3>
<p>
<cx "lujvo, examples of making">  XE "lujvo: examples of making"   <ex "doghouse">  XE "doghouse: example“  This section contains examples of making and scoring lujvo. First, we will start with the tanru “gerku zdani” (“dog house”) and construct a lujvo meaning “doghouse”, that is, a house where a dog lives. We will use a brute-force application of the algorithm in <a href=#s12>Section 12</a>, using every possible rafsi.
<p>
The rafsi for “gerku” are:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>		<dd>-ger-, -ge'u-, -gerk-, -gerku
</dl><p>The rafsi for “zdani” are:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>		<dd>-zda-, -zdan-, -zdani.
</dl><p>Step 1 of the algorithm directs us to use “-ger-”, “-ge'u-” and “-gerk-” as possible rafsi for “gerku”; Step 2 directs us to use “-zda-” and “-zdani” as possible rafsi for “zdani”. The six possible forms of the lujvo are then:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>	<dd>ger-zda
	ger-zdani
	ge'u-zda
	ge'u-zdani
	gerk-zda
	gerk-zdani
</dl><p>We must then insert appropriate hyphens in each case. The first two forms need no hyphenation: “ge” cannot fall off the front, because the following word would begin with “rz”, which is not a permissible initial consonant pair. So the lujvo forms are “gerzda” and “gerzdani”.
<p>
The third form, “ge'u-zda”, needs no hyphen, because even though the first rafsi is CVV, the second one is CCV, so there is a consonant cluster in the first five letters. So “ge'uzda” is this form of the lujvo.
<p>
The fourth form, “ge'u-zdani”, however, requires an “r”-hyphen; otherwise, the “ge'u-” part would fall off as a cmavo. So this form of the lujvo is “ge'urzdani”.
<p>
The last two forms require “y”-hyphens, as all 4-letter rafsi do, and so are “gerkyzda” and “gerkyzdani” respectively.
<p>
The scoring algorithm is heavily weighted in favor of short lujvo, so we might expect that “gerzda” would win. Its L score is 6, its A score is 0, its H score is 0, its R score is 12, and its V score is 3, for a final score of 5878. The other forms have scores of 7917, 6367, 9506, 8008, and 10047 respectively. Consequently, this lujvo would probably appear in the dictionary in the form “gerzda”.
<p>
<ex "boat class">  XE "boat class: example“  For the next example, we will use the tanru “bloti klesi” (“boat class”) presumably referring to the category (rowboat, motorboat, cruise liner) into which a boat falls. We will omit the long rafsi from the process, since lujvo containing long rafsi are almost never preferred by the scoring algorithm when there are short rafsi available.
<p>
The rafsi for “bloti” are “-lot-”, “-blo-”, and “-lo'i-”; for “klesi” they are “-kle-” and “-lei-”. Both these gismu are among the handful which have both CVV-form and CCV-form rafsi, so there is an unusual number of possibilities available for a two-part tanru:
<p>
<pre> 	lotkle	blokle	lo'ikle
	lotlei	blolei	lo'irlei

</pre><p>Only “lo'irlei” requires hyphenation (to avoid confusion with the cmavo sequence “lo'i lei”). All six forms are valid versions of the lujvo, as are the six further forms using long rafsi; however, the scoring algorithm produces the following results:
<p>
<pre> 	lotkle	5878	blokle	5858	lo'ikle	6367
	lotlei	5867	blolei	5847	lo'irlei	7456
</pre><p>So the form “blolei” is preferred, but only by a tiny margin over “blokle”;  “lotlei” and “lotkle” are only slightly worse; “lo'ikle” suffers because of its apostrophe, and “lo'irlei” because of having both apostrophe and hyphen.
<p>
<ex "Logical Language Group">  XE "Logical Language Group: example“  Our third example will result in forming both a lujvo and a name from the tanru “logji bangu girzu”, or “logical-language group” in English. (“The Logical Language Group” is the name of the publisher of this book and the organization for the promotion of Lojban.)
The available rafsi are “-loj-” and “-logj-”; “-ban-”, “-bau-”, and “-bang-”; and “-gri-” and “-girzu”, and (for name purposes only) “-gir-” and “-girz-”. The resulting 12 lujvo possibilities are:
<p>
<pre> 	loj-ban-gri	loj-bau-gri	loj-bang-gri
	logj-ban-gri	logj-bau-gri	logj-bang-gri
	loj-ban-girzu	loj-bau-girzu	loj-bang-girzu
	logj-ban-girzu	logj-bau-girzu	logj-bang-girzu
</pre>and the 12 name possibilities are:
<p>
<pre> 	loj-ban-gir.	loj-bau-gir.	loj-bang-gir.
	logj-ban-gir.	logj-bau-gir.	logj-bang-gir.
	loj-ban-girz.	loj-bau-girz.	loj-bang-girz.
	logj-ban-girz.	logj-bau-girz.	logj-bang-girz.
</pre><p>After hyphenation, we have:
<p>
<pre> 	lojbangri	lojbaugri	lojbangygri
	logjybangri	logjybaugri	logjybangygri
	lojbangirzu	lojbaugirzu	lojbangygirzu
	logjybangirzu	logjybaugirzu	logjybangygirzu
	lojbangir.	lojbaugir.	lojbangygir.
	logjybangir.	logjybaugir.	logjybangygir.
	lojbangirz.	lojbaugirz.	lojbangygirz.
	logjybangirz.	logjybaugirz.	logjybangygirz.
</pre><p>The only fully reduced lujvo forms are “lojbangri” and “lojbaugri”, of which the latter has a slightly lower score: 8827 versus 8796, respectively. However, for the name of the organization, we chose to make sure the name of the language was embedded in it, and to use the clearer long-form rafsi for “girzu”, producing “lojbangirz.”
<p>
<ex "male sexual teacher">  XE "male sexual teacher: example“  <ex "sexual teacher, male">  XE "sexual teacher: male, example“  Finally, here is a four-part lujvo with a cmavo in it, based on the tanru “nakni ke cinse ctuca” or “male (sexual teacher)”. The “ke” cmavo ensures the interpretation “teacher of sexuality who is male”, rather than “teacher of male sexuality”. Here are the possible forms of the lujvo, both before and after hyphenation:

<p>
<pre> 	nak-kem-cin-ctu	nakykemcinctu
	nak-kem-cin-ctuca	nakykemcinctuca
	nak-kem-cins-ctu	nakykemcinsyctu
	nak-kem-cins-ctuca	nakykemcinsyctuca
	nakn-kem-cin-ctu	naknykemcinctu
	nakn-kem-cin-ctuca	naknykemcinctuca
	nakn-kem-cins-ctu	naknykemcinsyctu
	nakn-kem-cins-ctuca	naknykemcinsyctuca
</pre><p>Of these forms, “nakykemcinctu” is the shortest and is preferred by the scoring algorithm. On the whole, however, it might be better to just make a lujvo for “cinse ctuca” (which would be “cinctu”) since the sex of the teacher is rarely important. If there was a reason to specify “male”, then the simpler tanru “nakni cinctu” (“male sexual-teacher”) would be appropriate. This tanru is actually shorter than the four-part lujvo, since the “ke” required for grouping need not be expressed.

<cx "source languages, use in creating gismu">  XE "source languages: use in creating gismu"   <dl compact><dt>1)	<dd>At least one word was found in each of the six source languages (Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, Russian, Arabic) corresponding to the proposed gismu. This word was rendered into Lojban phonetics rather liberally: consonant clusters consisting of a stop and the corresponding fricative were simplified to just the fricative (“tc” became “c”, “dj” became “j”) and non-Lojban vowels were mapped onto Lojban ones. Furthermore, morphological endings were dropped. The same mapping rules were applied to all six languages for the sake of consistency.
<p><dt>2)	<dd>All possible gismu forms were matched against the six source-language forms. The matches were scored as follows:
</dl><cx "gismu creation, scoring rules">  XE “gismu: creation, scoring rules"   <dl compact><dt>2a)	<dd>If three or more letters were the same in the proposed gismu and the source-language word, and appeared in the same order, the score was equal to the number of letters that were the same. Intervening letters, if any, did not matter.
<p><dt>2b)	<dd>If exactly two letters were the same in the proposed gismu and the source-language word, and either the two letters were consecutive in both words, or were separated by a single letter in both words, the score was 2. Letters in reversed order got no score. 
<p><dt>2c)	<dd>Otherwise, the score was 0.
<p><dt>3)	<dd>The scores were divided by the length of the source-language word in its Lojbanized form, and then multiplied by a weighting value specific to each language, reflecting the proportional number of first-language and second-language speakers of the language. (Second-language speakers were reckoned at half their actual numbers.) The weights were chosen to sum to 1.00. The sum of the weighted scores was the total score for the proposed gismu form.
</dl><cx "gismu creation, considerations for selection after scoring">  XE “gismu: creation, considerations for selection after scoring"   <dl compact><dt>4)	<dd>Any gismu forms that conflicted with existing gismu were removed. Obviously, being identical with an existing gismu constitutes a conflict. In addition, a proposed gismu that was identical to an existing gismu except for the final vowel was considered a conflict, since two such gismu would have identical 4-letter rafsi.

<cx "gismu creation, and transcription blunders">  XE “gismu: creation, and transcription blunders"   <dl compact><dt>5)	<dd>The gismu form with the highest score usually became the actual gismu. Sometimes a lower-scoring form was used to provide a better rafsi. A few gismu were changed in error as a result of transcription blunders (for example, the gismu “gismu” should have been “gicmu”, but it's too late to fix it now).
		</dl><cx "gismu, source-language weights for">  XE "gismu: source-language weights for"   The language weights used to make most of the gismu were as follows:
<p>
<pre> 	Chinese	0.36
	English	0.21
	Hindi		0.16
	Spanish	0.11
	Russian	0.09
	Arabic		0.07

		</dl>(English and Hindi switched places due to demographic changes.)
<p>
Note that the stressed vowel of the gismu was considered sufficiently distinctive that two or more gismu may differ only in this vowel; as an extreme example, “bradi”, “bredi”, “bridi”, and “brodi” (but fortunately not “brudi”) are all existing gismu.

<p>
<cx "gismu, exceptions to gismu creation by algorithm">  XE "gismu: exceptions to gismu creation by algorithm"   <cx "gismu, coined">  XE "gismu: coined"   The following gismu were not made by the gismu creation algorithm. They are, in effect, coined words similar to fu'ivla. They are exceptions to the otherwise mandatory gismu creation algorithm where there was sufficient justification for such exceptions. Except for the small metric prefixes and the assignable predicates beginning with “brod”, they all end in the letter “o”, which is otherwise a rare letter in Lojban gismu.
<p>
<cx "gismu, Lojban-specific">  XE "gismu: Lojban-specific"   The following gismu represent concepts that are sufficiently unique to Lojban that they were either coined from combining forms of other gismu, or else made up out of whole cloth. These gismu are thus conceptually similar to lujvo even though they are only five letters long; however, unlike lujvo, they have rafsi assigned to them for use in building more complex lujvo. Assigning gismu to these concepts helps to keep the resulting lujvo reasonably short.

</pre><p>It is important to understand that even though “cmavo”, “lojbo”, and “lujvo” were made up from parts of other gismu, they are now full-fledged gismu used in exactly the same way as all other gismu, both in grammar and in word formation.
<p>
<cx "gismu, scientific-mathematical">  XE "gismu: scientific-mathematical"   The following three groups of gismu represent concepts drawn from the international language of science and mathematics. They are used for concepts that are represented in most languages by a root which is recognized internationally.

</pre><p>The gismu “sinso” and “tanjo” were only made non-algorithmically because they were identical (having been borrowed from a common source) in all the dictionaries that had translations. The other terms in this group are units in the international metric system; some metric units, however, were made by the ordinary process (usually because they are different in Chinese).
<p>
<cx "gismu, cultural">  XE "gismu: cultural"   Finally, there are the cultural gismu, which are also borrowed, but by modifying a word from one particular language, instead of using the multi-lingual gismu creation algorithm. Cultural gismu are used for words that have local importance to a particular culture; other cultures or languages may have no word for the concept at all, or may borrow the word from its home culture, just as Lojban does. In such a case, the gismu algorithm, which uses weighted averages, doesn't accurately represent the frequency of usage of the individual concept. Cultural gismu are not even required to be based on the six major languages.

<p>
<cx "rafsi fu'ivla">  XE "rafsi fu'ivla proposal"   <cx "cultural words, rafsi fu'ivla proposal for">  XE "cultural words: rafsi fu'ivla proposal for"   The list of cultures represented by gismu, given in <a href=#s15>Section 15</a>, is unavoidably controversial. Much time has been spent debating whether this or that culture “deserves a gismu” or “must languish in fu'ivla space”. To help defuse this argument, a last-minute proposal was made when this book was already substantially complete. I have added it here with experimental status: it is not yet a standard part of Lojban, since all its implications have not been tested in open debate, and it affects a part of the language (lujvo-making) that has long been stable, but is known to be fragile in the face of small changes. (Many attempts were made to add general mechanisms for making lujvo that contained fu'ivla, but all failed on obvious or obscure counterexamples; finally the general “zei” mechanism was devised instead.)
<p>
<cx "CCVVCV fu'ivla, and rafsi fu'ivla proposal">  XE "CCVVCV fu'ivla: and rafsi fu'ivla proposal"   <cx "fu'ivla, form for rafsi fu'ivla proposal">  XE "fu'ivla: form for rafsi fu'ivla proposal"   The first part of the proposal is uncontroversial and involves no change to the language mechanisms. All valid Type 4 fu'ivla of the form CCVVCV would be reserved for cultural brivla analogous to those described in <a href=#s15>Section 15</a>. For example,
<p>
<pre><a name=e16d1>16.1)	tci'ile
	Chilean
is of the appropriate form, and passes all tests required of a Stage 4 fu'ivla. No two fu'ivla of this form would be allowed to coexist if they differed only in the final vowel; this rule was applied to gismu, but does not apply to other fu'ivla or to lujvo.
<p>
The second, and fully experimental, part of the proposal is to allow rafsi to be formed from these cultural fu'ivla by removing the final vowel and treating the result as a 4-letter rafsi (although it would contain five letters, not four). These rafsi could then be used on a par with all other rafsi in forming lujvo. The tanru
<p>
<ex "Chilean desert">  XE "Chilean desert: example“  <pre><a name=e16d2>16.2)	tci'ile ke canre tutra
	Chilean type-of (sand territory)
	Chilean desert
</pre>could be represented by the lujvo
<p>
<pre><a name=e16d3>16.3)	tci'ilykemcantutra
</pre>which is an illegal word in standard Lojban, but a valid lujvo under this proposal. There would be no short rafsi or 5-letter rafsi assigned to any fu'ivla, so no fu'ivla could appear as the last element of a lujvo.
<p>
The cultural fu'ivla introduced under this proposal are called “rafsi fu'ivla”, since they are distinguished from other Type 4 fu'ivla by the property of having rafsi. If this proposal is workable and introduces no problems into Lojban morphology, it might become standard for all Type 4 fu'ivla, including those made for plants, animals, foodstuffs, and other things.

<p>
<cx "bridi, definition">  XE "bridi: definition"   <cx "selbri, definition">  XE "selbri: definition"   <cx "selbri, relation to bridi">  XE "selbri: relation to bridi"   <cx "bridi, relation to selbri">  XE "bridi: relation to selbri"   At the center, logically and often physically, of every Lojban bridi is one or more words which constitute the selbri. A bridi expresses a relationship between things: the selbri specifies which relationship is referred to. The difference between:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	do mamta mi
	You are-a-mother-of me.
	You are my mother.
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d2>1.2)	do patfu mi
	You are-a-father-of me.
	You are my father.
</pre>lies in the different selbri.
<p>
<cx "selbri, brivla as">  XE "selbri: brivla as"   <cx "brivla as selbri">  XE "brivla as selbri"   <cx "brivla, types">  XE "brivla: types"   The simplest kind of selbri is a single Lojban content word: a brivla. There are three different varieties of brivla: those which are built into the language (the gismu), those which are derived from combinations of the gismu (the lujvo), and those which are taken (usually in a modified form) from other languages (the fu'ivla). In addition, there are a few cmavo that can act like brivla; these are mentioned in <a href=#s9>Section 9</a>, and discussed in full in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7</a>.
<p>
For the purposes of this chapter, however, all brivla are alike. For example,
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d3>1.3)	ta bloti
	That is-a-boat.
	That is a boat.
<a name=e1d4>1.4)	ta brablo
	That is-a-large-boat.
	That is a ship.
</pre<ex "schooner">  XE "schooner: example“  <pre><a name=e1d5>1.5)	ta blotrskunri
	That is-a-(boat)-schooner.
	That is a schooner.
</pre>illustrate the three types of brivla (gismu, lujvo, and fu'ivla respectively), but in each case the selbri is composed of a single word whose meaning can be learned independent of its origins.
<p>
The remainder of this chapter will mostly use gismu as example brivla, because they are short. However, it is important to keep in mind that wherever a gismu appears, it could be replaced by any other kind of brivla.
<p>
<a name=s2><h3>Simple tanru</h3>
<p>
<cx "tanru, simple">  XE "tanru: simple"   <cx "tanru, definition">  XE "tanru: definition"   Beyond the single brivla, a selbri may consist of two brivla placed together. When a selbri is built in this way from more than one brivla, it is called a tanru, a word with no single English equivalent. The nearest analogue to tanru in English are combinations of two nouns such as “lemon tree”. There is no way to tell just by looking at the phrase “lemon tree” exactly what it refers to, even if you know the meanings of “lemon” and “tree” by themselves. As English-speakers, we must simply know that it refers to “a tree which bears lemons as fruits”. A person who didn't know English very well might think of it as analogous to “brown tree” and wonder, “What kind of tree is lemon-colored?”
<p>
<cx "adverb-verb combination, with tanru">  XE "adverb-verb combination: with tanru"   <cx "adjective-noun combination, with tanru">  XE "adjective-noun combination: with tanru"   In Lojban, tanru are also used for the same purposes as English adjective-noun combinations like “big boy” and adverb-verb combinations like “quickly run”. This is a consequence of Lojban not having any such categories as “noun”, “verb”, “adjective”, or “adverb”. English words belonging to any of these categories are translated by simple brivla in Lojban. Here are some examples of tanru:
<p>
<ex "lemon tree">  XE "lemon tree: example“  <pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	tu pelnimre tricu
	That-yonder is-a-(lemon tree).
	That is a lemon tree.
<a name=e2d2>2.2)	la djan. barda nanla
	John is-a-big boy.
	John is a big boy.
<a name=e2d3>2.3)	mi sutra bajra
	I quick run.
	I quickly run/I run quickly.
</pre><p>Note that “pelnimre” is a lujvo for “lemon”; it is derived from the gismu “pelxu”, yellow, and “nimre”, citrus. Note also that “sutra” can mean “fast/quick” or “quickly” depending on its use:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d4>2.4)	mi sutra
	I am-fast/quick.
</pre><ex "quick runner">  XE "quick runner: example“  shows “sutra” used to translate an adjective, whereas in <a href=#e2d3>Example 2.3 </a>it is translating an adverb. (Another correct translation of <a href=#e2d3>Example 2.3</a>, however, would be “I am a quick runner”.)
<p>
<cx "seltau, definition of">  XE "seltau: definition of"   <cx "tertau, definition of">  XE "tertau: definition of"   There are special Lojban terms for the two components of a tanru, derived from the place structure of the word “tanru”. The first component is called the “seltau”, and the second component is called the “tertau”.
<p>
<cx "tanru, primary meaning of">  XE "tanru: primary meaning of"   <cx "tertau, effect on meaning of tanru">  XE "tertau: effect on meaning of tanru"   The most important rule for use in interpreting tanru is that the tertau carries the primary meaning. A “pelnimre tricu” is primarily a tree, and only secondarily is it connected with lemons in some way. For this reason, an alternative translation of <a href=#e2d1>Example 2.1 </a>would be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d5>2.5)	That is a lemon type of tree.
</pre><p>This “type of” relationship between the components of a tanru is fundamental to the tanru concept.
<p>
<cx "seltau, effect on meaning of tanru">  XE "seltau: effect on meaning of tanru"   <cx "modifier, seltau as">  XE "modifier: seltau as"   We may also say that the seltau modifies the meaning of the tertau:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d6>2.6)	That is a tree which is lemon-ish 	(in the way appropriate to trees)
</pre>would be another possible translation of <a href=#e2d1>Example 2.1</a>. In the same way, a more explicit translation of <a href=#e2d2>Example 2.2 </a>might be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d7>2.7)	John is a boy who is big in the way that boys are big.
</pre><p>This “way that boys are big” would be quite different from the way in which elephants are big; big-for-a-boy is small-for-an-elephant.
<p>
<cx "tanru, ambiguity of">  XE "tanru: ambiguity of"   <cx "ambiguity of tanru">  XE "ambiguity of tanru"   All tanru are ambiguous semantically. Possible translations of:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d8>2.8)	ta klama jubme
	That is-a-goer type-of-table.
</pre>include:
<p>
<ex "goer table">  XE "goer table: example“  <dl compact><dt>	<dd>That is a table which goes (a wheeled table, perhaps).
	That is a table owned by one who goes.
	That is a table used by those who go (a sports doctor's table?).
	That is a table when it goes (otherwise it is a chair?).
</dl><cx "tanru, as ambiguous">  XE "tanru: as ambiguous"   In each case the object referred to is a “goer type of table”, but the ambiguous “type of” relationship can mean one of many things. A speaker who uses tanru (and pragmatically all speakers must) takes the risk of being misunderstood. Using tanru is convenient because they are short and expressive; the circumlocution required to squeeze out all ambiguity can require too much effort.
<p>
<cx "tanru, meaning of">  XE "tanru: meaning of"   No general theory covering the meaning of all possible tanru exists; probably no such theory can exist. However, some regularities obviously do exist:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d9>2.9)	do barda prenu
	You are-a-large person.
<a name=e2d10>2.10)	do cmalu prenu
	You are-a-small person.
</pre>are parallel tanru, in the sense that the relationship between “barda” and “prenu” is the same as that between “cmalu” and “prenu”. <a href=#s14>Section 14 </a>and <a href=#s15>Section 15 </a>contain a partial listing of some types of tanru, with examples.
<p>
<a name=s3><h3>Three-part tanru grouping with “bo”</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	bo	BO	closest scope grouping
</pre><ex "girls' school, little">  XE "girls' school: little, example“  <cx "tanru grouping, three-part">  XE "tanru grouping: three-part"   Consider the English sentence:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d1>3.1)	That's a little girls' school.
</pre><p>What does it mean? Two possible readings are:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d2>3.2)	That's a little school for girls.
<a name=e3d3>3.3)	That's a school for little girls.
 </pre><cx "speech rhythm, for grouping in English">  XE "speech rhythm: for grouping in English"   This ambiguity is quite different from the simple tanru ambiguity described in <a href=#s2>Section 2</a>. We understand that “girls' school” means “a school where girls are the students”, and not “a school where girls are the teachers” or “a school which is a girl” (!). Likewise, we understand that “little girl” means “girl who is small”. This is an ambiguity of grouping. Is “girls' school” to be taken as a unit, with “little” specifying the type of girls' school? Or is “little girl” to be taken as a unit, specifying the type of school? In English speech, different tones of voice, or exaggerated speech rhythm showing the grouping, are used to make the distinction; English writing usually leaves it unrepresented.
<p>
<lx "bo">  XE "bo"   <lx "BO">  XE "BO selma’o"   Lojban makes no use of tones of voice for any purpose; explicit words are used to do the work. The cmavo “bo” (which belongs to selma'o BO) may be placed between the two brivla which are most closely associated. Therefore, a Lojban translation of <a href=#e3d2>Example 3.2 </a>would be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d4>3.4)	ta cmalu nixli bo ckule
	That is-a-small girl – school.
</pre><a href=#e3d3>Example 3.3 </a>might be translated:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d5>3.5)	ta cmalu bo nixli ckule
	That is-a-small – girl school.
</pre><p>The “bo” is represented in the literal translation by a hyphen because in written English a hyphen is sometimes used for the same purpose: “a big dog-catcher” would be quite different from a “big-dog catcher” (presumably someone who catches only big dogs).
<p>
<cx "tanru nested within tanru">  XE "tanru nested within tanru"   Analysis of <a href=#e3d4>Example 3.4 </a>and <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5 </a>reveals a tanru nested within a tanru. In <a href=#e3d4>Example 3.4</a>, the main tanru has a seltau of “cmalu” and a tertau of “nixli bo ckule”; the tertau is itself a tanru with “nixli” as the seltau and “ckule” as the tertau. In <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5</a>, on the other hand, the seltau is “cmalu bo nixli” (itself a tanru), whereas the tertau is “ckule”. This structure of tanru nested within tanru forms the basis for all the more complex types of selbri that will be explained below.
<p>
What about <a href=#e3d6>Example 3.6</a>? What does it mean?
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d6>3.6)	ta cmalu nixli ckule
	That is-a-small girl school.
</pre><cx "left-grouping rule, definition of">  XE "left-grouping rule: definition of"   <cx "tanru, default left-grouping of">  XE "tanru: default left-grouping of"   The rules of Lojban do not leave this sentence ambiguous, as the rules of English do with <a href=#e3d1>Example 3.1</a>. The choice made by the language designers is to say that <a href=#e3d6>Example 3.6 </a>means the same as <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5</a>. This is true no matter what three brivla are used: the leftmost two are always grouped together. This rule is called the “left-grouping rule”. Left-grouping in seemingly ambiguous structures is quite common — though not universal — in other contexts in Lojban.
<p>
Another way to express the English meaning of <a href=#e3d4>Example 3.4 </a>and <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5</a>, using parentheses to mark grouping, is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d7>3.7)	ta cmalu nixli bo ckule
	That is-a-small type-of (girl type-of school).
<a name=e3d8>3.8)	ta cmalu bo nixli ckule
	That is-a-(small type-of girl) type-of school.
</pre><p>Because “type-of” is implicit in the Lojban tanru form, it has no Lojban equivalent.
<p>
Note: It is perfectly legal, though pointless, to insert “bo” into a simple tanru:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d9>3.9)	ta klama bo jubme
	That is-a goer – table
</pre>is a legal Lojban bridi that means exactly the same thing as <a href=#e2d8>Example 2.8</a>, and is ambiguous in exactly the same ways. The cmavo “bo” serves only to resolve grouping ambiguity: it says nothing about the more basic ambiguity present in all tanru.

<p>
<a name=s4><h3>Complex tanru grouping</h3>
<p>
<cx "tanru grouping, complex">  XE "tanru grouping: complex"   If one element of a tanru can be another tanru, why not both elements?
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d1>4.1)	do mutce bo barda gerku bo kavbu
	You are-a-(very type-of large) (dog type-of capturer).
	You are a very large dog-catcher.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e4d1>Example 4.1</a>, the selbri is a tanru with seltau “mutce bo barda” and tertau “gerku bo kavbu”. It is worth emphasizing once again that this tanru has the same fundamental ambiguity as all other Lojban tanru: the sense in which the “dog type-of capturer” is said to be “very type-of large” is not precisely specified. Presumably it is his body which is large, but theoretically it could be one of his other properties.
<p>
<cx "pretty, English ambiguity of">  XE "pretty: English ambiguity of"   We will now justify the title of this chapter by exploring the ramifications of the phrase “pretty little girls' school”, an expansion of the tanru used in <a href=#s3>Section 3 </a>to four brivla. (Although this example has been used in the Loglan Project almost since the beginning — it first appeared in Quine's book <cite>Word and Object </cite>(1960) — it is actually a mediocre example because of the ambiguity of English “pretty”; it can mean “beautiful”, the sense intended here, or it can mean “very”. Lojban “melbi” is not subject to this ambiguity: it means only “beautiful”.)
Here are four ways to group this phrase:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d2>4.2)	ta melbi cmalu nixli ckule
	That is-a-((pretty type-of little) type-of girl) type-of school.
	That is a school for girls who are beautifully small.
<a name=e4d3>4.3)	ta melbi cmalu nixli bo ckule
	That is-a-(pretty type-of little) (girl type-of school).
	That is a girls' school which is beautifully small.
<a name=e4d4>4.4)	ta melbi cmalu bo nixli ckule
	That is-a-(pretty type-of (little type-of girl)) type-of school.
	That is a school for small girls who are beautiful.
<a name=e4d5>4.5)	ta melbi cmalu bo nixli bo ckule
	That is-a-pretty type-of (little type-of (girl type-of school)).
	That is a small school for girls which is beautiful.
</pre><cx "right-grouping rule, definition of">  XE "right-grouping rule: definition of"   <cx "right-grouping in tanru, with bo">  XE "right-grouping in tanru: with bo"   <cx "tanru grouping, with bo">  XE "tanru grouping: with bo"   <cx "bo, for right-grouping in tanru">  XE "bo: for right-grouping in tanru"   <a href=#e4d5>Example 4.5 </a>uses a construction which has not been seen before: “cmalu bo nixli bo ckule”, with two consecutive uses of “bo” between brivla. The rule for multiple “bo” constructions is the opposite of the rule when no “bo” is present at all: the last two are grouped together. Not surprisingly, this is called the “right-grouping rule”, and it is associated with every use of “bo” in the language. Therefore,
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d6>4.6)	ta cmalu bo nixli bo ckule
	That is-a-little type-of (girl type-of school).
</pre>means the same as <a href=#e3d4>Example 3.4</a>, not <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5</a>. This rule may seem peculiar at first, but one of its consequences is that “bo” is never necessary between the first two elements of any of the complex tanru presented so far: all of <a href=#e4d{2}>Examples 4.2 </a>through <a href=#e4d5>4.5 </a>could have “bo” inserted between “melbi” and “cmalu” with no change in meaning.
<p>
<a name=s5><h3>Complex tanru with “ke” and “ke'e”</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	ke	KE	start grouping
	ke'e	KEhE	end grouping
</pre><cx "grouping parentheses">  XE "grouping parentheses"   <lx "ke">  XE "ke"   <lx "ke'e">  XE "ke'e"   <lx "KE">  XE "KE selma’o"   <lx "KEhE">  XE "KEhE selma’o"   <cx "tanru grouping, with ke">  XE "tanru grouping: with ke"   There is, in fact, a fifth grouping of “pretty little girls' school” that cannot be expressed with the resources explained so far. To handle it, we must introduce the grouping parentheses cmavo, “ke” and “ke'e” (belonging to selma'o KE and KEhE respectively). Any portion of a selbri sandwiched between these two cmavo is taken to be a single tanru component, independently of what is adjacent to it. Thus, <a href=#e4d2>Example 4.2 </a>can be rewritten in any of the following ways:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	ta ke melbi cmalu ke'e nixli ckule
	That is-a-( pretty little ) girl school.
<a name=e5d2>5.2)	ta ke ke melbi cmalu ke'e nixli ke'e ckule
	That is-a-( ( pretty little ) girl ) school.
<a name=e5d3>5.3)	ta ke ke ke melbi cmalu ke'e nixli ke'e ckule ke'e
	That is-a-( ( ( pretty little ) girl ) school ).
</pre><p>Even more versions could be created simply by placing any number of “ke” cmavo at the beginning of the selbri, and a like number of “ke'e” cmavo at its end. Obviously, all of these are a waste of breath once the left-grouping rule has been grasped. However, the following is equivalent to <a href=#e4d4>Example 4.4 </a>and may be easier to understand:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d4>5.4)	ta melbi ke cmalu nixli ke'e ckule
	That is-a-(pretty type-of (little type-of girl) ) type-of school.
</pre><p>Likewise, a “ke” and “ke'e” version of <a href=#e4d3>Example 4.3 </a>would be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d5>5.5)	ta melbi cmalu ke nixli ckule [ke'e]
	That is-a-(pretty type-of little) (girl type-of school).
</pre><p>The final “ke'e” is given in square brackets here to indicate that it can be elided. It is always possible to elide “ke'e” at the end of the selbri, making <a href=#e5d5>Example 5.5 </a>as terse as <a href=#e4d3>Example 4.3</a>.
<p>
Now how about that fifth grouping? It is
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d6>5.6)	ta melbi ke cmalu nixli ckule [ke'e]
	That is-a-pretty type-of ( (little type-of girl) type-of school )
	That is a beautiful school for small girls.
</pre><a href=#e5d6>Example 5.6 </a>is distinctly different in meaning from any of Examples 4.2 through 4.5. Note that within the “ke <dots>…</dots>ke'e” parentheses, the left-grouping rule is applied to “cmalu nixli ckule”.
<p>
<cx "tanru grouping, with ke and bo">  XE "tanru grouping: with ke and bo"   It is perfectly all right to mix “bo” and “ke <dots>…</dots>ke'e” in a single selbri. For instance, <a href=#e4d5>Example 4.5</a>, which in pure “ke <dots>…</dots>ke'e” form is
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d7>5.7)	ta melbi ke cmalu ke nixli ckule [ke'e] [ke'e]
	That is-a-pretty type-of ( little type-of (girl type-of school) ).

</pre>can equivalently be expressed as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d8>5.8)	ta melbi ke cmalu nixli bo ckule [ke'e]
	That is-a-pretty type-of ( little type-of (girl type-of school) ).
</pre>and in many other different forms as well.
<p>
<a name=s6><h3>Logical connection within tanru</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	je	JA	tanru logical “and”
	ja	JA	tanru logical “or”
	joi	JOI	mixed mass “and”
	gu'e	GUhA	tanru forethought logical “and”
	gi	GI	forethought connection separator
</pre><ex "big red dog">  XE "big red dog: example“  Consider the English phrase “big red dog”. How shall this be rendered as a Lojban tanru? The naive attempt:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d1>6.1)	barda xunre gerku
	(big type-of red) type-of dog
</pre>will not do, as it means a dog whose redness is big, in whatever way redness might be described as “big”. Nor is
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d2>6.2)	barda xunre bo gerku
	big type-of (red type-of dog)
</pre><cx "adjective ordering">  XE "adjective ordering"   much better. After all, the straightforward understanding of the English phrase is that the dog is big as compared with other dogs, not merely as compared with other red dogs. In fact, the bigness and redness are independent properties of the dog, and only obscure rules of English adjective ordering prevent us from saying “red big dog”.
<p>
<cx "logical connectives, in tanru">  XE "logical connectives: in tanru"   <lx "je">  XE "je"   The Lojban approach to this problem is to introduce the cmavo “je”, which is one of the many equivalents of English “and”. A big red dog is one that is both big and red, and we can say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d3>6.3)	barda je xunre gerku
	(big and red) type-of dog
</pre><p>Of course,
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d4>6.4)	xunre je barda gerku
	(red and big) type-of dog
</pre><cx "logical connectives in tanru, effect on tanru grouping">  XE "logical connectives in tanru: effect on tanru grouping"   is equally satisfactory and means the same thing. As these examples indicate, joining two brivla with “je” makes them a unit for tanru purposes. However, explicit grouping with “bo” or “ke <dots>…</dots>ke'e” associates brivla more closely than “je” does:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d5>6.5)	barda je pelxu bo xunre gerku
	barda je ke pelxu xunre ke'e gerku
	(big and (yellow type-of red)) dog
	big yellowish-red dog

</pre><p>With no grouping indicators, we get:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d6>6.6)	barda je pelxu xunre gerku
	((big and yellow) type-of red) type-of dog
	biggish- and yellowish-red dog
</pre>which again raises the question of <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1</a>: what is does “biggish-red” mean?
<p>
<cx "logical connectives in tanru, usefulness of">  XE "logical connectives in tanru: usefulness of"   Unlike “bo” and “ke <dots>…</dots>ke'e”, “je” is useful as well as merely legal within simple tanru. It may be used to partly resolve the ambiguity of simple tanru:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d7>6.7)	ta blanu je zdani
	that is-blue and is-a-house
</pre>definitely refers to something which is both blue and is a house, and not to any of the other possible interpretations of simple “blanu zdani”. Furthermore, “blanu zdani” refers to something which is blue in the way that houses are blue; “blanu je zdani” has no such implication — the blueness of a “blanu je zdani” is independent of its houseness.
<p>
With the addition of “je”, many more versions of “pretty little girls' school” are made possible: see <a href=#s16>Section 16 </a>for a complete list.
<p>
A subtle point in the semantics of tanru like <a href=#e6d3>Example 6.3 </a>needs special elucidation. There are at least two possible interpretations of:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d8>6.8)	ta melbi je nixli ckule
	That is-a-(beautiful and girl) type-of school.
</pre><p>It can be understood as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d9>6.9)	That is a girls' school and a beautiful school.
</pre>or as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d10>6.10)	That is a school for things which are both girls and beautiful.
</pre><cx "logical connectives in tanru, ambiguity of">  XE "logical connectives in tanru: ambiguity of"   The interpretation specified by <a href=#e6d9>Example 6.9 </a>treats the tanru as a sort of abbreviation for:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d11>6.11)	ta ke melbi ckule ke'e je ke nixli ckule [ke'e]
	That is-a-( beautiful type-of school ) and (girl type-of school)
</pre>whereas the interpretation specified by <a href=#e6d10>Example 6.10 </a>does not. This is a kind of semantic ambiguity for which Lojban does not compel a firm resolution. The way in which the school is said to be of type “beautiful and girl” may entail that it is separately a beautiful school and a girls' school; but the alternative interpretation, that the members of the school are beautiful and girls, is also possible. Still another interpretation is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d12>6.12)	That is a school for beautiful things and also for girls.
</pre>so while the logical connectives help to resolve the meaning of tanru, they by no means compel a single meaning in and of themselves.
<p>
<cx "logical connectives in tanru, effect on formal logical manipulations">  XE "logical connectives in tanru: effect on formal logical manipulations"   In general, logical connectives within tanru cannot undergo the formal manipulations that are possible with the related logical connectives that exist outside tanru; see <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14 </a>for further details.
<p>
<lx "JA">  XE "JA selma’o"   The logical connective “je” is only one of the fourteen logical connectives that Lojban provides. Here are a few examples of some of the others:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d13>6.13)	le bajra cu jinga ja te jinga
	The runner(s) is/are winner(s) or loser(s).
<a name=e6d14>6.14)	blanu naja lenku skapi
	(blue only-if cold) skin
	skin which is blue only if it is cold
<a name=e6d15>6.15)	xamgu jo cortu nuntavla
	(good if-and-only-if short) speech
	speech which is good if (and only if) it is short
<a name=e6d16>6.16)	vajni ju selpluka nuntavla
	(important whether-or-not pleasing) event-of-talking
	speech which is important, whether or not it is pleasing
</pre><p>In <a href=#e6d13>Example 6.13</a>, “ja” is grammatically equivalent to “je” but means “or” (more precisely, “and/or”). Likewise, “naja” means “only if” in <a href=#e6d14>Example 6.14</a>, “jo” means “if and only if” in <a href=#e6d15>Example 6.15</a>, and “ju” means “whether or not” in <a href=#e6d16>Example 6.16</a>.
<p>
<cx "multiple logical connectives, within tanru">  XE "multiple logical connectives: within tanru"   Now consider the following example:

</pre><lx "jabo">  XE "jabo"   <cx "tanru grouping with JA+BO, effect on tanru grouping">  XE "tanru grouping with JA+BO: effect on tanru grouping"   which illustrates a new grammatical feature: the use of both “ja” and “bo” between tanru components. The two cmavo combine to form a compound whose meaning is that of “ja” but which groups more closely; “jabo” is to “ja” as plain “bo” is to no cmavo at all. However, both “ja” and “jabo” group less closely than “bo” does:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d18>6.18)	ricfu je blanu jabo crino bo blanu
	rich and (blue or green – blue)
	rich and (blue or greenish-blue)
</pre><p>An alternative form of <a href=#e6d17>Example 6.17 </a>is:
<p>

	rich and (blue or green)
</pre><cx "non-logical connectives, within tanru">  XE "non-logical connectives: within tanru"   In addition to the logical connectives, there are also a variety of non-logical connectives, grammatically equivalent to the logical ones. The only one with a well-understood meaning in tanru contexts is “joi”, which is the kind of “and” that denotes a mixture:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d20>6.20)	ti blanu joi xunre bolci
	This is-a-(blue and red) ball.
</pre><p>The ball described is neither solely red nor solely blue, but probably striped or in some other way exhibiting a combination of the two colors. <a href=#e6d20>Example 6.20 </a>is distinct from:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d21>6.21)	ti blanu xunre bolci
	This is a bluish-red ball
</pre>which would be a ball whose color is some sort of purple tending toward red, since “xunre” is the more important of the two components. On the other hand,
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d22>6.22)	ti blanu je xunre bolci
	This is a (blue and red) ball
</pre>is probably self-contradictory, seeming to claim that the ball is independently both blue and red at the same time, although some sensible interpretation may exist.
<p>
<cx "forethought logical connectives, within tanru">  XE "forethought logical connectives: within tanru"   <lx "gu'e">  XE "gu'e"   <lx "gi">  XE "gi"   Finally, just as English “and” has the variant form “both <dots>…</dots>and”, so “je” between tanru components has the variant form “gu'e <dots>…</dots>gi”, where “gu'e” is placed before the components and “gi” between them:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d23>6.23)	gu'e barda gi xunre gerku
	(both big and red) type-of dog
</pre>is equivalent in meaning to <a href=#e6d3>Example 6.3</a>. For each logical connective related to “je”, there is a corresponding connective related to “gu'e <dots>…</dots>gi” in a systematic way.

<cx "forethought logical connectives in tanru, effect on tanru grouping">  XE "forethought logical connectives in tanru: effect on tanru grouping"   The portion of a “gu'e <dots>…</dots>gi” construction before the “gi” is a full selbri, and may use any of the selbri resources including “je” logical connections. After the “gi”, logical connections are taken to be wider in scope than the “gu'e <dots>…</dots>gi”, which has in effect the same scope as “bo”:

The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	be	BE	linked sumti marker
	bei	BEI	linked sumti separator
	be'o	BEhO	linked sumti terminator
</pre><p>The question of the place structures of selbri has been glossed over so far. This chapter does not attempt to treat place structure issues in detail; they are discussed in <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>. One grammatical structure related to places belongs here, however. In simple sentences such as <a href=#e1d1>Example 1.1</a>, the place structure of the selbri is simply the defined place structure of the gismu “mamta”. What about more complex selbri?
<p>
<cx "tanru, place structures of">  XE "tanru: place structures of"   For tanru, the place structure rule is simple: the place structure of a tanru is always the place structure of its tertau. Thus, the place structure of “blanu zdani” is that of “zdani”: the x1 place is a house or nest, and the x2 place is its occupants.
<p>
What about the places of “blanu”? Is there any way to get them into the act? In fact, “blanu” has only one place, and this is merged, as it were, with the x1 place of “zdani”. It is whatever is in the x1 place that is being characterized as blue-for-a-house. But if we replace “blanu” with “xamgu”, we get:
<p>
<ex "good house">  XE "good house: example“  <pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	ti xamgu zdani

<p>
<pre><a name=e7d2>7.2)	ti xamgu be do bei mi [be'o] zdani

These sumti are not part of the overall bridi place structure, but fill the places of the brivla they are attached to, starting with x2. If there is more than one sumti, they are separated by the cmavo “bei” (of selma'o BEI), and the list of sumti is terminated by the elidable terminator “be'o” (of selma'o BEhO).
<p>
<cx "linked sumti, definition">  XE "linked sumti: definition"   Grammatically, a brivla with sumti linked to it in this fashion plays the same role in tanru as a simple brivla. To illustrate, here is a fully fleshed-out version of <a href=#e3d4>Example 3.4</a>, with all places filled in:

<lx "FA">  XE "FA selma’o"   <cx "linked sumti and FA tags">  XE "linked sumti and FA tags"   <cx "FA tags and linked sumti">  XE "FA tags and linked sumti"   It is possible to precede linked sumti by the place structure ordering tags “fe”, “fi”, “fo”, and “fu” (of selma'o FA, discussed further in <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>), which serve to explicitly specify the x2, x3, x4, and x5 places respectively. Normally, the place following the “be” is the x2 place and the other places follow in order. If it seems convenient to change the order, however, it can be accomplished as follows:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d7>7.7)	ti xamgu be fi mi bei fe do [be'o] zdani
	This is-a-good (by-standard me for you) house
</pre>which is equivalent in meaning to <a href=#e7d2>Example 7.2</a>. Note that the order of “be”, “bei”, and “be'o” does not change; only the inserted “fi” tells us that “mi” is the x3 place (and correspondingly, the inserted “fe” tells us that “do” is the x2 place). Changing the order of sumti is often done to match the order of another language, or for emphasis or rhythm.
<p>
Of course, using FA cmavo makes it easy to specify one place while omitting a previous place:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d8>7.8)	ti xamgu be fi mi [be'o] zdani
	This is-a-good (by-standard me) house

<p>
<pre><a name=e7d11>7.11)	le xamgu be do noi barda cu zdani

	the good (for the teacher ) house

<a name=s8><h3>Inversion of tanru: “co”</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	co	CO	tanru inversion marker
</pre><cx "tanru inversion">  XE "tanru inversion"   <lx "co">  XE "co"   The standard order of Lojban tanru, whereby the modifier precedes what it modifies, is very natural to English-speakers: we talk of “blue houses”, not of “houses blue”. In other languages, however, such matters are differently arranged, and Lojban supports this reverse order (tertau before seltau) by inserting the particle “co”. <a href=#e8d1>Example 8.1 </a>and <a href=#e8d2>Example 8.2 </a>mean exactly the same thing:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d1>8.1)	ta blanu zdani
	That is-a-blue type-of-house.
	That is a blue house.
<a name=e8d2>8.2)	ta zdani co blanu
	That is-a-house of-type blue.
	That is a blue house.
</pre><cx "tanru inversion, definition">  XE "tanru inversion: definition"   <cx "tertau, definition">  XE "tertau: definition"   <cx "seltau, definition">  XE "seltau: definition"   This change is called “tanru inversion”. In tanru inversion, the element before “co” (“zdani” in <a href=#e8d2>Example 8.2</a>) is the tertau, and the element following “co” (“blanu”) in <a href=#e8d2>Example 8.2</a>) is the seltau.
<p>
<cx "tanru inversion and place structure">  XE "tanru inversion and place structure"   <cx "place structure and tanru inversion">  XE "place structure and tanru inversion"   The meaning, and more specifically, the place structure, of a tanru is not affected by inversion: the place structure of “zdani co blanu” is still that of “zdani”. However, the existence of inversion in a selbri has a very special effect on any sumti which follow that selbri. Instead of being interpreted as filling places of the selbri, they actually fill the places (starting with x2) of the seltau. In <a href=#s7>Section 7</a>, we saw how to fill interior places with “be <dots>…</dots>bei <dots>…</dots>be'o”, and in fact <a href=#e8d3>Example 8.3 </a>and <a href=#e8d4>Example 8.4 </a>have the same meaning:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d3>8.3)	mi klama be le zarci bei le zdani be'o troci
	I am-a-(goer to the market from the house) type-of trier.
	I try to go to the market from the house.
<a name=e8d4>8.4)	mi troci co klama le zarci le zdani
	I am-a-trier of-type (goer to-the market from-the house).
	I try to go to the market from the house.
</pre><a href=#e8d4>Example 8.4 </a>is a less deeply nested construction, requiring fewer cmavo. As a result it is probably easier to understand.
<p>
<ex "try to go">  XE "try to go: example“  Note that in Lojban “trying to go” is expressed using “troci” as the tertau. The reason is that “trying to go” is a “going type of trying”, not a “trying type of going”. The trying is more fundamental than the going — if the trying fails, we may not have a going at all.
<p>
<cx "unfilled places of inverted tanru">  XE "unfilled places of inverted tanru"   <cx "inverted tanru, effect on sumti before the selbri">  XE "inverted tanru: effect on sumti before the selbri"   <cx "inverted tanru, effect on sumti after the selbri">  XE "inverted tanru: effect on sumti after the selbri"   Any sumti which precede a selbri with an inverted tanru fill the places of the selbri (i.e., the places of the tertau) in the ordinary way. In <a href=#e8d4>Example 8.4</a>, “mi” fills the x1 place of “troci co klama”, which is the x1 place of “troci”. The other places of the selbri remain unfilled. The trailing sumti “le zarci” and “le zdani” do not occupy selbri places, despite appearances.
<p>
As a result, the regular mechanisms (involving selma'o VOhA and GOhI, explained in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7</a>) for referring to individual sumti of a bridi cannot refer to any of the trailing places of <a href=#e8d4>Example 8.4</a>, because they are not really “sumti of the bridi” at all.
<p>
<cx "tanru inversion, in complex tanru">  XE "tanru inversion: in complex tanru"   <cx "tanru inversion, where allowed">  XE "tanru inversion: where allowed"   When inverting a more complex tanru, it is possible to invert it only at the most general modifier-modified pair. The only possible inversion of <a href=#e3d4>Example 3.4</a>, for instance, is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d5>8.5)	ta nixli [bo] ckule co cmalu
	That (is-a-girl type-of school) of-type little.
	That's a girls' school which is small.
</pre><cx "tanru inversion, effect on tanru grouping">  XE "tanru inversion: effect on tanru grouping"   <cx "tanru grouping, effect of tanru inversion on">  XE "tanru grouping: effect of tanru inversion on"   Note that the “bo” of <a href=#e3d4>Example 3.4 </a>is optional in <a href=#e8d5>Example 8.5</a>, because “co” groups more loosely than any other cmavo used in tanru, including none at all. Not even “ke <dots>…</dots>ke'e” parentheses can encompass a “co”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d6>8.6)	ta cmalu ke nixli ckule [ke'e] co melbi
	That is-a-(little type-of (girl type-of school)) of-type pretty.
	That's a small school for girls which is beautiful.
</pre><cx "tanru inversion, rule for removing">  XE "tanru inversion: rule for removing"   In <a href=#e8d6>Example 8.6</a>, the “ke'e” is automatically inserted before the “co” rather than at its usual place at the end of the selbri. As a result, there is a simple and mechanical rule for removing “co” from any selbri: change “A co B” to “ke B ke'e A”. (At the same time, any sumti following the selbri must be transformed into “be <dots>…</dots>bei <dots>…</dots>be'o” form and attached following B.) Therefore,
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d7>8.7)	ckule co melbi nixli
	school of-type pretty girl
	school for beautiful girls
</pre>means the same as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d8>8.8)	ke melbi nixli ke'e ckule
	(pretty girl) school
</pre><cx "tanru inversion, multiple">  XE "tanru inversion: multiple"   <cx "multiple tanru inversion, effect on grouping">  XE "multiple tanru inversion: effect on grouping"   Multiple “co” cmavo can appear within a selbri, indicating multiple inversions: a right-grouping rule is employed, as for “bo”. The above rule can be applied to interpret such selbri, but all “co” cmavo must be removed simultaneously:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d9>8.9)	ckule co nixli co cmalu
	school of-type (girl of-type little)
</pre>becomes formally
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d10>8.10)	ke ke cmalu ke'e nixli ke'e ckule
	( (little) girl ) school
</pre>which by the left-grouping rule is simply
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d11>8.11)	cmalu nixli ckule
	little girl school
	school for little girls
</pre><p>As stated above, the selbri places, other than the first, of
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d12>8.12)	mi klama co sutra
	I am-a-goer of-type quick
	I go quickly
</pre>cannot be filled by placing sumti after the selbri, because any sumti in that position fill the places of “sutra”, the seltau. However, the tertau places (which means in effect the selbri places) can be filled with “be”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d13>8.13)	mi klama be le zarci co sutra
	I am-a-goer (to the store) of-type quick.
	I go to the store quickly.

	du	GOhA	equality
	nu'a	NUhA	math operator to selbri
	moi	MOI	changes number to ordinal selbri
	mei	MOI	changes number to cardinal selbri
	nu	NU	event abstraction
	kei	KEI	terminator for “nu”
</pre><cx "brivla equivalents">  XE "brivla equivalents"   <cx "equivalents to brivla">  XE "equivalents to brivla"   So far we have only discussed brivla and tanru built up from brivla as possible selbri. In fact, there are a few other constructions in Lojban which are grammatically equivalent to brivla: they can be used either directly as selbri, or as components in tanru. Some of these types of simple selbri are discussed at length in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7</a>, <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11</a>, and <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18</a>; but for completeness these types are mentioned here with a brief explanation and an example of their use in selbri.
<p>
<lx "GOhA">  XE "GOhA selma’o"   <cx "GOhA, as selbri">  XE "GOhA selma’o: as selbri"   <cx "GOhA, as component in tanru">  XE "GOhA selma’o: as component in tanru"   <cx "selbri, with GOhA">  XE "selbri: with GOhA"   <cx "tanru, with GOhA">  XE "tanru: with GOhA"   The cmavo of selma'o GOhA (with one exception) serve as pro-bridi, providing a reference to the content of other bridi; none of them has a fixed meaning. The most commonly used member of GOhA is probably “go'i”, which amounts to a repetition of the previous bridi, or part of it. If I say:
<p>
<lx "go'i">  XE "go'i"   <pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	la djan. klama le zarci
	John goes-to the market.
</pre>you may retort:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d2>9.2)	la djan. go'i troci
	John [repeat last] are-a-tryer
	John tries to.
</pre><a href=#e9d2>Example 9.2 </a>is short for:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d3>9.3)	la djan. klama be le zarci be'o troci
	John is-a-goer (to the market) type-of trier.
</pre>because the whole bridi of <a href=#e9d1>Example 9.1 </a>has been packaged up into the single word “go'i” and inserted into <a href=#e9d2>Example 9.2</a>.
<p>
<cx "du, as an exception in GOhA">  XE "du: as an exception within GOhA selma’o"   The exceptional member of GOhA is “du”, which represents the relation of identity. Its place structure is:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>du:  <dd>x1 is identical with x2, x3, <dots>…</dots>
</dl>for as many places as are given. More information on selma'o GOhA is available in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7</a>.

Mathematical operators such as “su'i”, meaning “plus”, can be transformed into selbri by prefixing them with “nu'a” (of selma'o NUhA). The resulting place structure is:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>x1 is the result of applying (the operator) to arguments x2, x3, etc.
</dl>for as many arguments as are required. (The result goes in the x1 place because the number of following places may be indefinite.) For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d4>9.4)	li vo nu'a su'i li re li re
	The-number 4 is-the-sum-of the-number 2 and-the-number 2.

	I understand something about the-mass-of is-the-sum-of problems.
	I understand addition problems.
</pre><lx "MOI">  XE "MOI selma’o"   More usefully, it is possible to combine a mathematical expression with a cmavo of selma'o MOI to create one of various numerical selbri. Details are available in <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18</a>. Here are a few tanru:
<p>
<ex "Preem Palver">  XE "Preem Palver: example“  <pre><a name=e9d6>9.6)	la prim. palvr. pamoi cusku

	Anyi and Asun are two brothers.
</pre><lx "NU">  XE "NU selma’o"   <lx "KEI">  XE "KEI selma’o"   Finally, an important type of simple selbri which is not a brivla is the abstraction. Grammatically, abstractions are simple: a cmavo of selma'o NU, followed by a bridi, followed by the elidable terminator “kei” of selma'o KEI. Semantically, abstractions are an extremely subtle and powerful feature of Lojban whose full ramifications are documented in <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11</a>. For example:
<p>
<cx "abstraction bridi, contrasted with component non-abstraction bridi in meaning">  XE "abstraction bridi: contrasted with component non-abstraction bridi in meaning"   <pre><a name=e9d8>9.8)	ti nu zdile kei kumfa

<pre><a name=e9d9>9.9)	ti zdile kumfa
	This is-an-amuser room.
</pre>which suggests the meaning “a room that amuses someone”.
<p>
<a name=s10><h3>selbri based on sumti: “me”</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	me	ME	changes sumti to simple selbri
	me'u	MEhU	terminator for “me”
</pre><lx "me">  XE "me"   <lx "ME">  XE "ME selma’o"   <lx "me'u">  XE "me'u"   <lx "MEhU">  XE "MEhU selma’o"   <cx "selbri from sumti">  XE "selbri from sumti"   <cx "sumti into selbri">  XE "sumti into selbri"   <cx "conversion, sumti into selbri">  XE "conversion of sumti into selbri"   <cx "me, place structure of">  XE "me: place structure of"   A sumti can be made into a simple selbri by preceding it with “me” (of selma'o ME) and following it with the elidable terminator “me'u” (of selma'o MEhU). This makes a selbri with the place structure
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>x1 is one of the referents of “[the sumti]”
</dl>which is true of the thing, or things, that are the referents of the sumti, and not of anything else. For example, consider the sumti
<p>

	the three noblest-governors
	the three kings
</pre><ex "Three Kings">  XE "Three Kings: example“  If these are understood to be the Three Kings of Christian tradition, who arrive every year on January 6, then we may say:

<pre><a name=e10d2>10.2)	la BALtazar. cu me le ci nolraitru
	Balthazar is one-of-the-referents-of “the three kings”.

<pre><a name=e10d5>10.5)	do du la djan.
	You are-identical-with the-one-called “John”.
	You are John.

<pre><a name=e10d6>10.6)	do me la djan.
	You are-the-referent-of “the-one-called ‘John’”.
	You are John.
</pre><cx "“me” and names">  XE "me: used with names"   It is common to use “me” selbri, especially those based on name sumti using “la”, as seltau. For example:
<p>
<ex "Chrysler">  XE "Chrysler: example“  <pre><a name=e10d7>10.7)	ta me lai kraislr. [me'u] karce
	That (is-a-referent of “the-mass-called ‘Chrysler’”) car.

</pre><cx "elidability of “me'u”">  XE "elidability of me'u"   <cx "me'u, relative precedence with logical connectives">  XE "me'u: relative precedence with logical connectives"   <cx "logical connectives, relative precedence with me'u">  XE "logical connectives: relative precedence with me'u"   The elidable terminator “me'u” can usually be omitted. It is absolutely required only if the “me” selbri is being used in an indefinite description (a type of sumti explained in <a href=chap6.html>Chapter 6</a>), and if the indefinite description is followed by a relative clause (explained in <a href=chap8.html>Chapter 8</a>) or a sumti logical connective (explained in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>). Without a “me'u”, the relative clause or logical connective would appear to belong to the sumti embedded in the “me” expression. Here is a contrasting pair of sentences:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d8>10.8)	re me le ci nolraitru .e la djan. [me'u] cu blabi
	Two of the group “the three kings and John” are white.
<a name=e10d9>10.9)	re me le ci nolraitru me'u .e la djan. cu blabi
	Two of the three kings, and John, are white.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e10d8>Example 10.8 </a>the “me” selbri covers the three kings plus John, and the indefinite description picks out two of them that are said to be white: we cannot say which two. In <a href=#e10d9>Example 10.9</a>, though, the “me” selbri covers only the three kings: two of them are said to be white, and so is John.
<p>
Finally, here is another example requiring “me'u”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d10>10.10)	ta me la'e le se cusku be do me'u cukta
	That is-a-(what-you-said) type of book.
	That is the kind of book you were talking about.
</pre><p>There are other sentences where either “me'u” or some other elidable terminator must be expressed:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d11>10.11)	le me le ci nolraitru [ku] me'u nunsalci
	the (the three kings) type-of-event-of-celebrating
	the Three Kings celebration
</pre>requires either “ku” or “me'u” to be explicit, and (as with “be'o” in <a href=#s7>Section 7</a>) the “me'u” leaves no doubt which cmavo it is paired with.
<p>
<a name=s11><h3>Conversion of simple selbri</h3>
<p>
<lx "SE">  XE "SE selma’o"   <lx "se">  XE "se"   <lx "te">  XE "te"   <lx "ve">  XE "ve"   <lx "xe">  XE "xe"   <cx "conversion and tanru">  XE "conversion and tanru"   <cx "tanru and conversion">  XE "tanru and conversion"   <cx "conversion, definition">  XE "conversion: definition"   <cx "place structure, re-ordering by conversion">  XE "place structure: re-ordering by conversion"   Conversion is the process of changing a selbri so that its places appear in a different order. This is not the same as labeling the sumti with the cmavo of FA, as mentioned in <a href=#s7>Section 7</a>, and then rearranging the order in which the sumti are spoken or written. Conversion transforms the selbri into a distinct, though closely related, selbri with renumbered places.
<p>
In Lojban, conversion is accomplished by placing a cmavo of selma'o SE before the selbri:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d1>11.1)	mi prami do
	I love you.
</pre>is equivalent in meaning to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d2>11.2)	do se prami mi
	You [swap x1 and x2] love me.
	You are loved by me.
</pre><p>Conversion is fully explained in <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>. For the purposes of this chapter, the important point about conversion is that it applies only to the following simple selbri. When trying to convert a tanru, therefore, it is necessary to be careful! Consider <a href=#e11d3>Example 11.3</a>:
<p>
<ex "walk to market">  XE "walk to market: example“  <pre><a name=e11d3>11.3)	la .alis. cu cadzu klama le zarci
	Alice is-a-walker type-of goer to-the market.
	Alice walkingly goes to the market.
	Alice walks to the market.
</pre><p>To convert this sentence so that “le zarci” is in the x1 place, one correct way is:

</pre><cx "conversion with `ke'">  XE "conversion with `ke'"   <cx "ke, for conversion of tanru">  XE "ke: for conversion of tanru"   The “ke <dots>…</dots>ke'e” brackets cause the entire tanru to be converted by the “se”, which would otherwise convert only “cadzu”, leading to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d5>11.5)	le zarci cu se cadzu klama la .alis.
	The market (is-a-[swap x1/x2] walker) type-of goer to Alice.
	The market is-a-walking-surface type-of goer to Alice.
</pre>whatever that might mean. An alternative approach, since the place structure of “cadzu klama” is that of “klama” alone, is to convert only the latter:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d6>11.6)	le zarci cu cadzu se klama la .alis.
	The market walkingly is-gone-to by-Alice.
</pre><p>But the tanru in <a href=#e11d6>Example 11.6 </a>may or may not have the same meaning as that in <a href=#e11d3>Example 11.3</a>; in particular, because “cadzu” is not converted, there is a suggestion that although Alice is the goer, the market is the walker. With a different sumti as x1, this seemingly odd interpretation might make considerable sense:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d7>11.7)	la djan. cu cadzu se klama la .alis
	John walkingly is-gone-to by Alice

<p>
<lx "NAhE">  XE "NAhE selma’o"   <cx "scalar negation, effect on selbri">  XE "scalar negation: effect on selbri"   <cx "selbri, scalar negation of">  XE "selbri: scalar negation of"   Negation is too large and complex a topic to explain fully in this chapter; see <a href=chap15.html>Chapter 15</a>. In brief, there are two main types of negation in Lojban. This section is concerned with so-called “scalar negation”, which is used to state that a true relation between the sumti is something other than what the selbri specifies. Scalar negation is expressed by cmavo of selma'o NAhE:
<p>
<cx "ke, for expanding scope of scalar negation">  XE "ke: for expanding scope of scalar negation"   <pre><a name=e12d1>12.1)	la .alis. cu na'e ke cadzu klama [ke'e] le zarci
	Alice non- (walkingly goes) to-the market.
	Alice other-than (walkingly goes) to-the market.
	Alice doesn't walk to the market.
</pre>meaning that Alice's relationship to the market is something other than that of walking there. But if the “ke” were omitted, the result would be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d2>12.2)	la .alis. cu na'e cadzu klama le zarci
	Alice non- walkingly goes to-the market.
	Alice doesn't walk to the market.
</pre>meaning that Alice does go there in some way (“klama” is not negated), but by a means other than that of walking. <a href=#e12d1>Example 12.1 </a>negates both “cadzu” and “klama”, suggesting that Alice's relation to the market is something different from walkingly-going; it might be walking without going, or going without walking, or neither.
<p>
Of course, any of the simple selbri types explained in <a href=#s9>Section 9 </a>may be used in place of brivla in any of these examples:

<p>
<pre><a name=e12d3>12.3)	la djonz. cu na'e pamoi cusku
	Jones is non-1st speaker
	Jones is not the first speaker.
</pre><p>Since only “pamoi” is negated, an appropriate inference is that he is some other kind of speaker.
<p>
<cx "complex negation, examples">  XE "complex negation: examples"   <cx "negation, complex examples">  XE "negation: complex examples"   Here is an assortment of more complex examples showing the interaction of scalar negation with “bo” grouping, “ke” and “ke'e” grouping, logical connection, and sumti linked with “be” and “bei”:
<p>
<cx "na'e, contrasted with na'e ke">  XE "na'e: contrasted with na'e ke"   <pre><a name=e12d4>12.4)	mi na'e sutra cadzu be fi le birka be'o klama le zarci
	I ( (non-quickly) (walking using the arms) ) go-to the market.
	I go to the market, walking using my arms other than quickly.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e12d4>Example 12.4</a>, “na'e” negates only “sutra”. Contrast <a href=#e12d5>Example 12.5</a>:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d5>12.5)	mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka [be'o] ke'e klama le zarci
	I non-( quickly (walking using the arms) ) go-to the market.
	I go to the market, other than by walking quickly on my arms.
</pre><p>Now consider <a href=#e12d6>Example 12.6 </a>and <a href=#e12d7>Example 12.7</a>, which are equivalent in meaning, but use “ke” grouping and “bo” grouping respectively:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d6>12.6)	mi sutra cadzu be fi le birka be'o je masno klama le zarci
	I (quickly – (walking using the arms) and slowly) go-to the market.
	I go to the market, both quickly walking using my arms and slowly.
<a name=e12d7>12.7)	mi ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka [be'o] ke'e je masno klama le zarci
	I ((quickly (walking using the arms)) and slowly) go-to the market.
	I go to the market, both quickly walking using my arms and slowly.
</pre><p>However, if we place a “na'e” at the beginning of the selbri in both <a href=#e12d6>Example 12.6 </a>and <a href=#e12d7>Example 12.7</a>, we get different results:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d8>12.8)	mi na'e sutra cadzu be fi le birka be'o je masno klama le zarci
	I ((non- quickly) – (walking using the arms) and slowly) go-to the market.
	I go to the market, both walking using my arms other than quickly, and 
also slowly.
<a name=e12d9>12.9)	mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka [be'o] ke'e je masno klama le zarci
	I (non-(quickly (walking using the arms)) and slowly) go-to the market.
	I go to the market, both other than quickly walking using my arms, and 
also slowly.
</pre><p>The difference arises because the “na'e” in <a href=#e12d9>Example 12.9 </a>negates the whole construction from “ke” to “ke'e”, whereas in <a href=#e12d8>Example 12.8 </a>it negates “sutra” alone.
<p>
<cx "omitting terminators, perils of">  XE "omitting terminators: perils of"   <cx "perils of omitting terminators">  XE "perils of omitting terminators"   Beware of omitting terminators in these complex examples! If the explicit “ke'e” is left out in <a href=#e12d9>Example 12.9</a>, it is transformed into:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d10>12.10)	mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka be'o je masno klama [ke'e] le zarci
	I non-(quickly ((walking using the arms)) and slowly) go-to) the market.
	I do something other than quickly both going to the market walking 
using my arms and slowly going to the market.

</pre><p>And if both “ke'e” and “be'o” are omitted, the results are even sillier:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d11>12.11)	mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka je masno klama [be’o] [ke'e] le zarci
	I non-(quickly walk on my (arm-type and slow) goers) on the market.
	I do something other than quickly walking using the goers, both arm-type 
and slow, relative-to the market.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e12d11>Example 12.11</a>, everything after “be” is a linked sumti, so the place structure is that of “cadzu”, whose x2 place is the surface walked upon. It is less than clear what an “arm-type goer” might be. Furthermore, since the x3 place has been occupied by the linked sumti, the “le zarci” following the selbri falls into the nonexistent x4 place of “cadzu”. As a result, the whole example, though grammatical, is complete nonsense. (The bracketed Lojban words appear where a fluent Lojbanist would understand them to be implied.)
<p>
<cx "na'e, before gu'e">  XE "na'e: before gu'e"   Finally, it is also possible to place “na'e” before a “gu'e <dots>…</dots>gi” logically connected tanru construction. The meaning of this usage has not yet been firmly established.
<p>
<a name=s13><h3>Tenses and bridi negation</h3>
<p>
A bridi can have cmavo associated with it which specify the time, place, or mode of action. For example, in
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d1>13.1)	mi pu klama le zarci
	I [past] go to-the market.
	I went to the market.
</pre>the cmavo “pu” specifies that the action of the speaker going to the market takes place in the past. Tenses are explained in full detail in <a href=chap10.html>Chapter 10</a>. Tense is semantically a property of the entire bridi; however, the usual syntax for tenses attaches them at the front of the selbri, as in <a href=#e13d1>Example 13.1</a>. There are alternative ways of expressing tense information as well. Modals, which are explained in <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>, behave in the same way as tenses.
<p>
Similarly, a bridi may have the particle “na” (of selma'o NA) attached to the beginning of the selbri to negate the bridi. A negated bridi expresses what is false without saying anything about what is true. Do not confuse this usage with the scalar negation of <a href=#s12>Section 12</a>. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d2>13.2)	la djonz. na pamoi cusku
	Jones (Not!) is-the-first speaker
	It is not true that Jones is the first speaker.
	Jones isn't the first speaker.
</pre><p>Jones may be the second speaker, or not a speaker at all; <a href=#e13d2>Example 13.2 </a>doesn't say. There are other ways of expressing bridi negation as well; the topic is explained fully in <a href=chap15.html>Chapter 15</a>.

<p>
<pre><a name=e13d5>13.5)	mi na pu na ca klama le zarci
	I [not] [past] [not] [present] go to-the market
	It is not the case that in the past it was not the case that in the present I

As for “kanla denci”, the relationship is not only not present on the surface, it is hardly possible to formulate it at all.

<a name=s15><h3>Some types of symmetrical tanru</h3>
<p>
<cx "symmetrical tanru">  XE "symmetrical tanru"   This section deals with symmetrical tanru, where order is not important. Many of these tanru can be expressed with a logical or non-logical connective between the components.
<p>
<cx "symmetrical tanru types, both separately true">  XE "symmetrical tanru types: both separately true"   The tanru may refer to things which are correctly specified by both tanru components. Some of these instances may also be seen as asymmetrical tanru where the seltau specifies a material. The connective “je” is appropriate:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>	cipnrstrigi pacru'i	<dd>owl demon (Skt) 
	nolraitru prije		royal sage (Skt) 
	remna nakni		human-being male (Qab = man)

	zdani tcadu		home town (Chi)
	cipnrstrigi = fu'ivla for “owl” based on Linnean name
	pacru'i = evil-spirit
	tolvri = opposite-of-brave

</dl><cx "symmetrical tanru types, one or other true">  XE "symmetrical tanru types: one or other true"   The tanru may refer to all things which are specified by either of the tanru components. The connective “ja” is appropriate:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>	nunji'a nunterji'a	<dd>victory defeat (Skt = victory or defeat) 
	donri nicte		day night (Skt = day and night) 
	lunra tarci		moon stars (Skt = moon and stars) 
	patfu mamta		father mother (Imb,Kaz,Chi = parents) 
	tuple birka		leg arm (Kaz = extremity) 
	nuncti nunpinxe	eating drinking (Udm = cuisine) 
	bersa tixnu		son daughter (Chi = children)
	nunji'a = event-of-winning

	nuncti = event-of-eating
	nunpinxe = event-of-drinking
</dl><cx "symmetrical tanru types, using more inclusive class">  XE "symmetrical tanru types: using more inclusive class"   Alternatively, the tanru may refer to things which are specified by either of the tanru components or by some more inclusive class of things which the components typify:

	jalra curnu		beetle worm (Mon = insect) 
	kabri palta		cup plate (Kaz = crockery)

</dl><cx "symmetrical tanru types, using crucial/typical parts">  XE "symmetrical tanru types: using crucial/typical parts"   The tanru components specify crucial or typical parts of the referent of the tanru as a whole:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>	tumla vacri		<dd>land air (Fin = world) 
	moklu stedu		mouth head (Aba = face) 
	sudysrasu cunmi	hay millet (Qab = agriculture) 
	gugde ciste		state system (Mon = politics)

 “Pretty little girls' school”: forty ways to say it</h3>
<p></dl><cx "pretty little girls' school, forty ways">  XE "pretty little girls' school: forty ways, examples"   
The following examples show every possible grouping arrangement of “melbi cmalu nixli ckule” using “bo” or “ke <dots>…</dots>ke'e” for grouping and “je” or “jebo” for logical connection. Most of these are definitely not plausible interpretations of the English phrase “pretty little girls' school”, especially those which describe something which is both a girl and a school.
<p>
Examples 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 5.6 are repeated here as Examples 16.1, 16.9, 16.17, 16.25, and 16.33 respectively. The seven examples following each of these share the same grouping pattern, but differ in the presence or absence of “je” at each possible site. Some of the examples have more than one Lojban version. In that case, they differ only in grouping mechanism, and are always equivalent in meaning.
<p>
The logical connective “je” is associative: that is, “A and (B and C)” is the same as “(A and B) and C”. Therefore, some of the examples have the same meaning as others. In particular, 16.8, 16.16, 16.24, 16.32, and 16.40 all have the same meaning because all four brivla are logically connected and the grouping is simply irrelevant. Other equivalent forms are noted in the examples themselves. However, if “je” were replaced by “naja” or “jo” or most of the other logical connectives, the meanings would become distinct.
<p>
It must be emphasized that, because of the ambiguity of all tanru, the English translations are by no means definitive — they represent only one possible interpretation of the corresponding Lojban sentence.

To Speak Of Many Things: The Lojban sumti</h2>
<h6>$Revision: 4.1 $<br>
mkhtml: 1.1</h6></p></center>
<p>
<a name=s1><h3>The five kinds of simple sumti</h3>
<p>
<cx "simple sumti">  XE "simple sumti"   <cx "sumti, definition">  XE "sumti: definition"   If you understand anything about Lojban, you know what a sumti is by now, right? An argument, one of those things that fills the places of simple Lojban sentences like:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	mi klama le zarci
	I go-to the market
</pre><cx "pro-sumti, contrasted with description">  XE "pro-sumti: contrasted with description"   In <a href=#e1d1>Example 1.1</a>, “mi” and “le zarci” are the sumti. It is easy to see that these two sumti are not of the same kind: “mi” is a pro-sumti (the Lojban analogue of a pronoun) referring to the speaker, whereas “le zarci” is a description which refers to something described as being a market.
<p>
<cx "sumti, kinds of">  XE "sumti: kinds of"   There are five kinds of simple sumti provided by Lojban:
<p>
<cx "sumti, descriptions as">  XE "sumti: descriptions as"   <cx "gadri, definition">  XE "gadri: definition"   <lx "le">  XE "le"   <dl compact><dt>1)	<dd>descriptions like “le zarci”, which usually begin with a descriptor (called a “gadri” in Lojban) such as “le”;
</dl><cx "sumti, pro-sumti as">  XE "sumti: pro-sumti as"   <lx "mi">  XE "mi"   <dl compact><dt>2)	<dd>pro-sumti, such as “mi”;
</dl><cx "sumti, names as">  XE "sumti: names as"   <lx "la">  XE "la"   <dl compact><dt>3)	<dd>names, such as “la lojban.”, which usually begin with “la”;
</dl><cx "sumti, quotations as">  XE "sumti: quotations as"   <lx "lu">  XE "lu"   <lx "le'u">  XE "le'u"   <lx "zo">  XE "zo"   <lx "zoi">  XE "zoi"   <dl compact><dt>4)	<dd>quotations, which begin with “lu”, “le'u”, “zo”, or “zoi”;
</dl><cx "sumti, numbers as">  XE "sumti: numbers as"   <lx "li">  XE "li"   <dl compact><dt>5)	<dd>pure numbers, which usually begin with “li”.
</dl><p>Here are a few examples of each kind of sumti:
<p>
<lx "ko">  XE "ko"   <pre><a name=e1d2>1.2)	e'osai ko sarji la lojban.
	Please support Lojban!
</pre><a href=#e1d2>Example 1.2 </a>exhibits “ko”, a pro-sumti; and “la lojban.”, a name.
<p>
<lx "mi">  XE "mi"   <lx "lu">  XE "lu"   <lx "li'u">  XE "li'u"   <lx "le">  XE "le"   <pre><a name=e1d3>1.3)	mi cusku lu e'osai li'u le tcidu
	I express “Please!” to-the reader.
</pre><a href=#e1d3>Example 1.3 </a>exhibits “mi”, a pro-sumti; “lu e'osai li'u”, a quotation; and “le tcidu”, a description.
<p>
<lx "ti">  XE "ti"   <lx "li">  XE "li"   <pre><a name=e1d4>1.4)	ti mitre li ci
	This measures-in-meters the-number three.
	This is three meters long.
</pre><a href=#e1d4>Example 1.4 </a>exhibits “ti”, a pro-sumti; and “li ci”, a number.
<p>
Most of this chapter is about descriptions, as they have the most complicated syntax and usage. Some attention is also given to names, which are closely interwoven with descriptions. Pro-sumti, numbers, and quotations are described in more detail in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7</a>, <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18</a>, and <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19 </a>respectively, so this chapter only gives summaries of their forms and uses. See <a href=#s13>Section 13 </a>through <a href=#s15>Section 15 </a>for these summaries.

<p>
<a name=s2><h3>The three basic description types</h3>
<p>
<cx "descriptions, types of">  XE "descriptions: types of"   The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre>	le	LE	the, the one(s) described as
	lo	LE	some, some of those which really are
	la	LA	the one(s) named
	ku	KU	elidable terminator for LE, LA
</pre><cx "descriptions, types of">  XE "descriptions: types of"   <cx "descriptions, components of">  XE "descriptions: components of"   <cx "descriptor, as part of description">  XE "descriptor: as part of description"   <cx "selbri, as part of description">  XE "selbri: as part of description"   <lx "LE">  XE "LE selma’o"   <lx "LA">  XE "LA selma’o"   The syntax of descriptions is fairly complex, and not all of it can be explained within the confines of this chapter: relative clauses, in particular, are discussed in <a href=chap8.html>Chapter 8</a>. However, most descriptions have just two components: a descriptor belonging to selma'o LE or LA, and a selbri. (The difference between selma'o LE and selma'o LA is not important until <a href=#s12>Section 12</a>.) Furthermore, the selbri is often just a single brivla. Here is an elementary example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	le zarci
	one-or-more-specific-things-each-of-which-I-describe-as being-a-market
	the market
</pre><cx "le, compared with English “the”">  XE "le: compared with English \”the\”"   The long gloss for “le” is of course far too long to use most of the time, and in fact “le” is quite close in meaning to English “the”. It has particular implications, however, which “the” does not have.
<p>
<cx "descriptors, purpose of">  XE "descriptors: purpose of"   <cx "descriptions, importance of selbri first place in">  XE "descriptions: importance of selbri first place in"   The general purpose of all descriptors is to create a sumti which might occur in the x1 place of the selbri belonging to the description. Thus “le zarci” conveys something which might be found in the x1 place of “zarci”, namely a market.
<p>
<cx "le, implications of">  XE "le: implications of"   <cx "le, and specificity">  XE "le: and specificity"   <cx "le, and truth of selbri">  XE "le: and truth of selbri"   The specific purpose of “le” is twofold. First, it indicates that the speaker has one or more specific markets in mind (whether or not the listener knows which ones they are). Second, it also indicates that the speaker is merely describing the things he or she has in mind as markets, without being committed to the truth of that description.
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d2>2.2)	le zarci cu barda
	One-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe as “markets” is/are-big.
	The market is big.
	The markets are big.
</pre><cx "plurals, Lojban contrasted with English in necessity of marking">  XE "plural: Lojban contrasted with English in necessity of marking"   Note that English-speakers must state whether a reference to markets is to just one (“the market”) or to more than one (“the markets”). Lojban requires no such forced choice, so both colloquial translations of <a href=#e2d2>Example 2.2 </a>are valid. Only the context can specify which is meant. (This rule does not mean that Lojban has no way of specifying the number of markets in such a case: that mechanism is explained in <a href=#s7>Section 7</a>.)
<p>
<ex "The men are women">  XE "The men are women: example“  Now consider the following strange-looking example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d3>2.3)	le nanmu cu ninmu
	One-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe as “men” are women
	The man is a woman.
	The men are women.
</pre><cx "le, in false-to-fact descriptions">  XE "le: in false-to-fact descriptions"   <a href=#e2d3>Example 2.3 </a>is not self-contradictory in Lojban, because “le nanmu” merely means something or other which, for my present purposes, I choose to describe as a man, whether or not it really is a man. A plausible instance would be: someone we had assumed to be a man at a distance turned out to be actually a woman on closer observation. <a href=#e2d3>Example 2.3 </a>is what I would say to point out my observation to you.
<p>
<cx "specific descriptions">  XE "specific descriptions"   <cx "descriptions, specific">  XE "descriptions: specific"   In all descriptions with “le”, the listener is presumed to either know what I have in mind or else not to be concerned at present (perhaps I will give more identifying details later). In particular, I might be pointing at the supposed man or men: <a href=#e2d3>Example 2.3 </a>would then be perfectly intelligible, since “le nanmu” merely clarifies that I am pointing at the supposed man, not at a landscape, or a nose, which happens to lie in the same direction.
<p>
<cx "non-specific descriptions">  XE "non-specific descriptions"   <cx "descriptions, non-specific">  XE "descriptions: non-specific"   <lx "lo">  XE "lo"   <cx "lo, implications of">  XE "lo: implications of"   The second descriptor dealt with in this section is “lo”. Unlike “le”, “lo” is nonspecific:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d4>2.4)	lo zarci
	one-or-more-of-all-the-things-which-really are-markets
	a market
	some markets
</pre><cx "lo, contrasted with le in specificity">  XE "lo: contrasted with le in specificity"   <cx "le, contrasted with lo in specificity">  XE "le: contrasted with lo in specificity"   <cx "le, contrasted with lo in truth requirement">  XE "le: contrasted with lo in truth requirement"   <cx "lo, contrasted with le in truth requirement">  XE "lo: contrasted with le in truth requirement"   <cx "lo, and truth of selbri">  XE "lo: and truth of selbri"   Again, there are two colloquial English translations. The effect of using “lo” in <a href=#e2d4>Example 2.4 </a>is to refer generally to one or more markets, without being specific about which. Unlike “le zarci”, “lo zarci” must refer to something which actually is a market (that is, which can appear in the x1 place of a truthful bridi whose selbri is “zarci”). Thus
<p>
<dl compact><dt>2.5)	<dd>lo nanmu cu ninmu
	Some man is a woman.
	Some men are women.
</dl>must be false in Lojban, given that there are no objects in the real world which are both men and women. Pointing at some specific men or women would not make <a href=#e2d5>Example 2.5 </a>true, because those specific individuals are no more both-men-and-women than any others. In general, “lo” refers to whatever individuals meet its description.
<p>
<lx "la">  XE "la"   <cx "la, implications of">  XE "la: implications of"   <cx "la, compared with le in specificity">  XE "la: compared with le in specificity"   <cx "le, compared with la in specificity">  XE "le: compared with la in specificity"   <cx "la, use with descriptions contrasted with use before Lojbanized names">  XE "la: use with descriptions contrasted with use before Lojbanized names"   The last descriptor of this section is “la”, which indicates that the selbri which follows it has been dissociated from its normal meaning and is being used as a name. Like “le” descriptions, “la” descriptions are implicitly restricted to those I have in mind. (Do not confuse this use of “la” with its use before regular Lojbanized names, which is discussed in <a href=#s12>Section 12</a>.) For example:
<p>
<ex "bear wrote story">  XE "bear wrote story: example“  <pre><a name=e2d6>2.6)	la cribe pu finti le lisri
	The-one-named “bear” [past] creates the story.
	Bear wrote the story.
</pre><cx "naming predicate">  XE "naming predicate"   In <a href=#e2d6>Example 2.6</a>, “la cribe” refers to someone whose naming predicate is “cribe”, i.e. “Bear”. In English, most names don't mean anything, or at least not anything obvious. The name “Frank” coincides with the English word “frank”, meaning “honest”, and so one way of translating “Frank ate some cheese” into Lojban would be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d7>2.7)	la stace pu citka lo cirla
	The-one-called “Honest/Frank” [past] eats some cheese.
</pre><p>English-speakers typically would not do this, as we tend to be more attached to the sound of our names than their meaning, even if the meaning (etymological or current) is known. Speakers of other languages may feel differently. (In point of fact, “Frank” originally meant “the free one” rather than “the honest one”.)

<p>
<cx "la, contrasted with le in implications">  XE "la: contrasted with le in implications"   It is important to note the differences between <a href=#e2d6>Example 2.6 </a>and the following:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d8>2.8)	le cribe pu finti le lisri
	One-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe-as a-bear
[past] creates the story.
	The bear(s) wrote the story.
</pre><cx "la, contrasted with lo in implications">  XE "la: contrasted with lo in implications"   <pre><a name=e2d9>2.9)	lo cribe pu finti le lisri
	One-or-more-of-the-things-which-really are-bears
		[past] creates the story.
	A bear wrote the story.
	Some bears wrote the story.
</pre><a href=#e2d8>Example 2.8 </a>is about a specific bear or bearlike thing(s), or thing(s) which the speaker (perhaps whimsically or metaphorically) describes as a bear (or more than one); <a href=#e2d9>Example 2.9 </a>is about one or more of the really existing, objectively defined bears. In either case, though, each of them must have contributed to the writing of the story, if more than one bear (or “bear”) is meant.
<p>
<cx "descriptions with lo, teddy bear contrasted with real bear">  XE "descriptions with lo: teddy bear contrasted with real bear"   (The notion of a “really existing, objectively defined bear” raises certain difficulties. Is a panda bear a “real bear”? How about a teddy bear? In general, the answer is “yes”. Lojban gismu are defined as broadly as possible, allowing tanru and lujvo to narrow down the definition. There probably are no necessary and sufficient conditions for defining what is and what is not a bear that can be pinned down with complete precision: the real world is fuzzy. In borderline cases, “le” may communicate better than “lo”.)
<p>
So while <a href=#e2d6>Example 2.6 </a>could easily be true (there is a real writer named “Greg Bear”), and <a href=#e2d8>Example 2.8 </a>could be true if the speaker is sufficiently peculiar in what he or she describes as a bear, <a href=#e2d9>Example 2.9 </a>is certainly false.
<p>
Similarly, compare the following two examples, which are analogous to <a href=#e2d8>Example 2.8 </a>and <a href=#e2d9>Example 2.9 </a>respectively:
<p>
<cx "le, contrasted with lo in implications">  XE "le: contrasted with lo in implications"   <cx "lo, contrasted with le in implications">  XE "lo: contrasted with le in implications"   <pre><a name=e2d10>2.10)	le remna pu finti le lisri

	A human being wrote the story.
	Some human beings wrote the story.
</pre><a href=#e2d10>Example 2.10 </a>says who the author of the story is: one or more particular human beings that the speaker has in mind. If the topic of conversation is the story, then <a href=#e2d10>Example 2.10 </a>identifies the author as someone who can be pointed out or who has been previously mentioned; whereas if the topic is a person, then “le remna” is in effect a shorthand reference to that person. <a href=#e2d11>Example 2.11 </a>merely says that the author is human.

It can almost always be omitted with no danger of ambiguity. The main exceptions are in certain uses of relative clauses, which are discussed in <a href=chap8.html>Chapter 8</a>, and in the case of a description immediately preceding the selbri. In this latter case, using an explicit “cu” before the selbri makes the “ku” unnecessary. There are also a few other uses of “ku”: in the compound negator “naku” (discussed in <a href=chap15.html>Chapter 15</a>) and to terminate place-structure, tense, and modal tags that do not have associated sumti (discussed in <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9 </a>and <a href=chap10.html>Chapter 10</a>).
<p>
<a name=s3><h3>Individuals and masses</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	lei	LE	the mass I describe as
	loi	LE	part of the mass of those which really are
	lai	LA	the mass of those named
</pre><cx "sumti, classified by types of objects referred to">  XE "sumti: classified by types of objects referred to"   <cx "sumti, for individual objects">  XE "sumti: for individual objects"   <cx "sumti, for mass objects">  XE "sumti: for mass objects"   <cx "sumti, for set objects">  XE "sumti: for set objects"   All Lojban sumti are classified by whether they refer to one of three types of objects, known as “individuals”, “masses”, and “sets”. The term “individual” is misleading when used to refer to more than one object, but no less-confusing term has as yet been found. All the descriptions in <a href=#s1>Sections 1 </a>and <a href=#s2>2 </a>refer to individuals, whether one or more than one. Consider the following example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d1>3.1)	le prenu cu bevri le pipno
	One-or-more-of-those-I-describe-as persons carry the piano.
	The person(s) carry the piano.
</pre>(Of course the second “le” should really get the same translation as the first, but I am putting the focus of this discussion on the first “le”, the one preceding “prenu”. I will assume that there is only one piano under discussion.)
<p>
<cx "plurals with le, meaning of">  XE "plural: meaning of le with"   <cx "le, meaning of in the plural">  XE "le: meaning of in the plural"   <cx "multiple individual objects, meaning of">  XE "multiple individual objects: meaning of"   <cx "individual objects, multiple">  XE "individual objects: multiple"   Suppose the context of <a href=#e3d1>Example 3.1 </a>is such that you can determine that I am talking about three persons. What am I claiming? I am claiming that each of the three persons carried the piano. This claim can be true if the persons carried the piano one at a time, or by turns, or in a variety of other ways. But in order for <a href=#e3d1>Example 3.1 </a>to be true, I must be willing to assert that person 1 carried the piano, and that person 2 carried the piano, and that person 3 carried the piano.
<p>
But suppose I am not willing to claim that. For in fact pianos are heavy, and very few persons can carry a piano all by themselves. The most likely factual situation is that person 1 carried one end of the piano, and person 2 the other end, while person 3 either held up the middle or else supervised the whole operation without actually lifting anything. The correct way of expressing such a situation in Lojban is:
<p>
<lx "lei">  XE "lei"   <pre><a name=e3d2>3.2)	lei prenu cu bevri le pipno
	The-mass-of-one-or-more-of-those-I-describe-as persons carry the piano.
</pre><ex "piano-moving">  XE "piano-moving: example“  <cx "mass object, contrasted with multiple individual objects">  XE "mass object: contrasted with multiple individual objects"   <cx "multiple individual objects, contrasted with mass object">  XE "multiple individual objects: contrasted with mass object"   <cx "mass object, properties of">  XE "mass object: properties of"   <cx "mass object, and logical reasoning">  XE "mass object: and logical reasoning"   Here the same three persons are treated not as individuals, but as a so-called “mass entity”, or just “mass”. A mass has the properties of each individual which composes it, and may have other properties of its own as well. This can lead to apparent contradictions. Thus suppose in the piano-moving example above that person 1 has fair skin, whereas person 2 has dark skin. Then it is correct to say that the person-mass has both fair skin and dark skin. Using the mass descriptor “lei” signals that ordinary logical reasoning is not applicable: contradictions can be maintained, and all sorts of other peculiarities may exist. However, we can safely say that a mass inherits only the component properties that are relevant to it; it would be ludicrous to say that a mass of two persons is of molecular dimensions, simply because some of the parts (namely, the molecules) of the persons are that small.
<p>
<lx "loi">  XE "loi"   <lx "lai">  XE "lai"   <cx "loi, as mass counterpart of lo">  XE "loi: as mass counterpart of lo"   <cx "lai, as mass counterpart of lai">  XE "lai: as mass counterpart of lai"   The descriptors “loi” and “lai” are analogous to “lo” and “la” respectively, but refer to masses either by property (“loi”) or by name (“lai”). A classic example of “loi” use is:

<p>
<ex "lions in Africa">  XE "lions in Africa: example“  <pre><a name=e3d3>3.3)	loi cinfo cu xabju le fi'ortu'a
	Part-of-the-mass-of-those-which-really are-lions dwell in-the African-land.
	The lion dwells in Africa.
	Lions dwell in Africa.
</pre><cx "lei, contrasted with loi in specificity">  XE "lei: contrasted with loi in specificity"   <cx "loi, contrasted with lei in specificity">  XE "loi: contrasted with lei in specificity"   The difference between “lei” and “loi” is that “lei cinfo” refers to a mass of specific individuals which the speaker calls lions, whereas “loi cinfo” refers to some part of the mass of all those individuals which actually are lions. The restriction to “some part of the mass” allows statements like <a href=#e3d3>Example 3.3 </a>to be true even though some lions do not dwell in Africa — they live in various zoos around the world. On the other hand, <a href=#e3d3>Example 3.3 </a>doesn't actually say that most lions live in Africa: equally true is
<p>
<ex "Englishman in Africa">  XE "Englishman in Africa: example“  <pre><a name=e3d4>3.4)	loi glipre

	Part-of-the-mass-of-those-which-really are-English-persons 
		dwell in-the African-land.
	The English dwell in Africa.
</pre>since there is at least one English person living there. <a href=#s4>Section 4 </a>explains another method of saying what is usually meant by “The lion lives in Africa” which does imply that living in Africa is normal, not exceptional, for lions.
<p>
<cx "mass objects, peculiarities of English translation of">  XE "mass objects: peculiarities of English translation of"   Note that the Lojban mass articles are sometimes translated by English plurals (the most usual case), sometimes by English singulars (when the singular is used to express typicalness or abstraction), and sometimes by singulars with no article:
<p>
<ex "butter is soft">  XE "butter is soft: example“  <lx "matne">  XE "matne"   <pre><a name=e3d5>3.5)	loi matne cu ranti
	Part-of-the-mass-of-that-which-really is-a-quantity-of-butter is-soft.
	Butter is soft.
</pre><cx "mass object, as dependent on intention">  XE "mass object: as dependent on intention"   Of course, some butter is hard (for example, if it is frozen butter), so the “part-of” implication of “loi” becomes once again useful. The reason this mechanism works is that the English words like “butter”, which are seen as already describing masses, are translated in Lojban by non-mass forms. The place structure of “matne” is “x1 is a quantity of butter from source x2”, so the single English word “butter” is translated as something like “a part of the mass formed from all the quantities of butter that exist”. (Note that the operation of forming a mass entity does not imply, in Lojban, that the components of the mass are necessarily close to one another or even related in any way other than conceptually. Masses are formed by the speaker's intention to form a mass, and can in principle contain anything.)
<p>
<cx "mass name, use of">  XE "mass name: use of"   The mass name descriptor “lai” is used in circumstances where we wish to talk about a mass of things identified by a name which is common to all of them. It is not used to identify a mass by a single name peculiar to it. Thus the mass version of <a href=#e2d5>Example 2.5</a>,
<p>
<ex "Bears wrote book">  XE "Bears wrote book: example“  <pre><a name=e3d6>3.6)	lai cribe pu finti le vi cukta
	The-mass-of-those-named “bear” [past] creates the nearby book.
	The Bears wrote this book.
</pre><cx "la, contrasted with lai in implications">  XE "la: contrasted with lai in implications"   <cx "lai, contrasted with la in implications">  XE "lai: contrasted with la in implications"   in a context where “la cribe” would be understood as plural, would mean that either Tom Bear or Fred Bear (to make up some names) might have written the book, or that Tom and Fred might have written it as collaborators. Using “la” instead of “lai” in <a href=#e3d6>Example 3.6 </a>would give the implication that each of Tom and Fred, considered individually, had written it.
<p>
<a name=s4><h3>Masses and sets</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	le'i	LE	the set described as
	lo'i	LE	the set of those which really are
	la'i	LA	the set of those named
</pre><cx "set, contrasted with mass in attribution of component properties">  XE "set: contrasted with mass in attribution of component properties"   <cx "mass, contrasted with set in attribution of component properties">  XE "mass: contrasted with set in attribution of component properties"   <cx "set, compared with mass as abstract of multiple individuals">  XE "set: compared with mass as abstract of multiple individuals"   <cx "mass, compared with set as abstract of multiple individuals">  XE "mass: compared with set as abstract of multiple individuals"   Having said so much about masses, let us turn to sets. Sets are easier to understand than masses, but are more rarely used. Like a mass, a set is an abstract object formed from a number of individuals; however, the properties of a set are not derived from any of the properties of the individuals that compose it.
<p>
<cx "inclusion, property of sets">  XE "inclusion: property of sets"   <cx "membership, property of sets">  XE "membership: property of sets"   <cx "cardinality, property of sets">  XE "cardinality: property of sets"   <cx "cardinality, definition">  XE "cardinality: definition"   <cx "sets, properties of">  XE "sets: properties of"   <lx "le'i">  XE "le'i"   <lx "lo'i">  XE "lo'i"   <lx "la'i">  XE "la'i"   <cx "le'i, as set counterpart of lei">  XE "le'i: as set counterpart of lei"   <cx "lo'i, as set counterpart of loi">  XE "lo'i: as set counterpart of loi"   <cx "la'i, as set counterpart of lai">  XE "la'i: as set counterpart of lai"   Sets have properties like cardinality (how many elements in the set), membership (the relationship between a set and its elements), and set inclusion (the relationship between two sets, one of which — the superset – contains all the elements of the other — the subset). The set descriptors “le'i”, “lo'i” and “la'i” correspond exactly to the mass descriptors “lei”, “loi”, and “lai” except that normally we talk of the whole of a set, not just part of it. Here are some examples contrasting “lo”, “loi”, and “lo'i”:
<p>
<cx "lo, contrasted with loi and lo'i">  XE "lo: contrasted with loi and lo'i"   <cx "loi, contrasted with lo and lo'i">  XE "loi: contrasted with lo and lo'i"   <cx "lo'i, contrasted with lo and loi">  XE "lo'i: contrasted with lo and loi"   <cx "rats are brown">  XE "rats are brown: example"   <pre><a name=e4d1>4.1)	lo ratcu cu bunre

	Rats are small.
<a name=e4d3>4.3)	lo'i ratcu cu barda
	The-set-of rats is-large.
	There are a lot of rats.
</pre><p>The mass of rats is small because at least one rat is small; the mass of rats is also large; the set of rats, though, is unquestionably large – it has billions of members. The mass of rats is also brown, since some of its components are; but it would be incorrect to call the set of rats brown — brown-ness is not the sort of property that sets possess.
<p>
<cx "sets, use in Lojban place structure">  XE "sets: use in Lojban place structure"   Lojban speakers should generally think twice before employing the set descriptors. However, certain predicates have places that require set sumti to fill them. For example, the place structure of “fadni” is:
fadni:  <p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>x1 is ordinary/common/typical/usual in property x2 
among the members of set x3
</dl><p>Why is it necessary for the x3 place of “fadni” to be a set? Because it makes no sense for an individual to be typical of another individual: an individual is typical of a group. In order to make sure that the bridi containing “fadni” is about an entire group, its x3 place must be filled with a set:
<p>
<ex "typical Lojban user">  XE "typical Lojban user: example“  <pre><a name=e4d4>4.4)	mi fadni zo’e lo'i lobypli
	I am-ordinary among the-set-of Lojban-users.
	I am a typical Lojban user.

</pre><p>Note that the x2 place has been omitted; I am not specifying in exactly which way I am typical — whether in language knowledge, or age, or interests, or something else. If “lo'i” were changed to “lo” in <a href=#e4d4>Example 4.4</a>, the meaning would be something like “I am typical of some Lojban user”, which is nonsense.
<p>
<a name=s5><h3>Descriptors for typical objects</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	lo'e	LE	the typical
	le'e	LE	the stereotypical
</pre><lx "lo'e">  XE "lo'e"   As promised in <a href=#s3>Section 3</a>, Lojban has a method for discriminating between “the lion” who lives in Africa and “the Englishman” who, generally speaking, doesn't live in Africa even though some Englishmen do. The descriptor “lo'e” means “the typical”, as in
<p>
<ex "lion in Africa">  XE "lion in Africa: example“  <pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	lo'e cinfo cu xabju le fi'ortu'a

</pre><cx "typical objects, determining characteristics of">  XE "typical objects: determining characteristics of"   <cx "typical objects, and instantiation">  XE "typical objects: and instantiation"   What is this “typical lion”? Surely it is not any particular lion, because no lion has all of the “typical” characteristics, and (worse yet) some characteristics that all real lions have can't be viewed as typical. For example, all real lions are either male or female, but it would be bizarre to suppose that the typical lion is either one. So the typical lion has no particular sex, but does have a color (golden brown), a residence (Africa), a diet (game), and so on. Likewise we can say that

There is a similar relationship between “le'e” and “le'i”:

The word “stereotypical” is often derogatory in English, but “le'e” need not be derogatory in Lojban: it simply suggests that the example is typical in the speaker's imagination rather than in some objectively agreed-upon way. Of course, different speakers may disagree about what the features of “the typical lion” are (some would include having a short intestine, whereas others would know nothing of lions' intestines), so the distinction between “lo'e cinfo” and “le'e cinfo” may be very fine.

<a name=s6><h3>Quantified sumti</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	ro	PA	all of/each of
	su'o	PA	at least (one of)
</pre><cx "quantifiers, with sumti">  XE “quantifier: with sumti"   <cx "sumti, as having implicit quantifiers">  XE "sumti: as having implicit quantifiers"   Quantifiers tell us how many: in the case of quantifiers with sumti, how many things we are talking about. In Lojban, quantifiers are expressed by numbers and mathematical expressions: a large topic discussed in some detail in <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18</a>. For the purposes of this chapter, a simplified treatment will suffice. Our examples will employ either the simple Lojban numbers “pa”, “re”, “ci”, “vo”, and “mu”, meaning “one”, “two”, “three”, “four”, “five” respectively, or else one of four special quantifiers, two of which are discussed in this section and listed above. These four quantifiers are important because every Lojban sumti has either one or two of them implicitly present in it — which one or two depends on the particular kind of sumti. There is more explanation of implicit quantifiers later in this section. (The other two quantifiers, “piro” and “pisu'o”, are explained in <a href=#s7>Section 7</a>.)
<p>
<cx "sumti, with explicit quantifiers">  XE "sumti: with explicit quantifiers"   <cx "quantifiers, explicit on sumti">  XE “quantifier: explicit on sumti"   Every Lojban sumti may optionally be preceded by an explicit quantifier. The purpose of this quantifier is to specify how many of the things referred to by the sumti are being talked about. Here are some simple examples contrasting sumti with and without explicit quantifiers:
<p>
<cx "sumti with explicit quantifier, contrasted with sumti without explicit quantifier">  XE "sumti with explicit quantifier: contrasted with sumti without explicit quantifier"   <pre><a name=e6d1>6.1)	do cadzu le bisli
	You walk-on the ice.
<a name=e6d2>6.2)	re do cadzu le bisli
	Two-of you walk-on the ice.
</pre><cx "number, meaning of when used as a quantifier">  XE "numbers: meaning when used as quantifiers"   <cx "quantifiers on sumti, numbers as an exact amounts">  XE "quantifier: on sumti, indicating exact number"   The difference between <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1 </a>and <a href=#e6d2>Example 6.2 </a>is the presence of the explicit quantifier “re” in the latter example. Although “re” by itself means “two”, when used as a quantifier it means “two-of”. Out of the group of listeners (the number of which isn't stated), two (we are not told which ones) are asserted to be “walkers on the ice”. Implicitly, the others (if any) are not walkers on the ice. In Lojban, you cannot say “I own three shoes” if in fact you own four shoes. Numbers need never be specified, but if they are specified they must be correct.
<p>
<cx "quantifiers on sumti, expressing inexact amounts with">  XE "quantifier: on sumti, expressing inexact amount with"   (This rule does not mean that there is no way to specify a number which is vague. The sentence
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d3>6.3)	mi ponse su'o ci cutci
	I possess at-least three shoes.
</pre><cx "vague numbers">  XE "vague numbers"   is true if you own three shoes, or four, or indeed any larger number. More details on vague numbers appear in the discussion of mathematical expressions in <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18</a>.)
<p>
Now consider <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1 </a>again. How many of the listeners are claimed to walk on the ice? The answer turns out to be: all of them, however many that is. So <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1 </a>and <a href=#e6d4>Example 6.4</a>:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d4>6.4)	ro do cadzu le bisli
	All-of you walk-on the ice.
</pre><cx "implicit quantifier, on personal pro-sumti">  XE "implicit quantifier: on personal pro-sumti"   <lx "ro">  XE "ro"   <cx "ro, as implicit quantifier on personal pro-sumti">  XE "ro: as implicit quantifier on personal pro-sumti"   <cx "personal pro-sumti, implicit quantifier for">  XE "personal pro-sumti: implicit quantifier for"   <cx "implicit quantifier, definition">  XE "implicit quantifier: definition"   turn out to mean exactly the same thing. This is a safe strategy, because if one of my listeners doesn't turn out to be walking on the ice, I can safely claim that I didn't intend that person to be a listener! And in fact, all of the personal pro-sumti such as “mi” and “mi'o” and “ko” obey the same rule. We say that personal pro-sumti have a so-called “implicit quantifier” of “ro” (all). This just means that if no quantifier is given explicitly, the meaning is the same as if the implicit quantifier had been used.
<p>
<cx "implicit quantifier, on quotations, discussion of">  XE "implicit quantifier: on quotations, discussion of"   Not all sumti have “ro” as the implicit quantifier, however. Consider the quotation in:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d5>6.5)	mi cusku lu do cadzu le bisli li'u
	I express [quote] you walk-on the ice [unquote].
	I say, “You walk on the ice.”
</pre><p>What is the implicit quantifier of the quotation “lu do cadzu le bisli li'u”? Surely not “ro”. If “ro” were supplied explicitly, thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d6>6.6)	mi cusku ro lu do cadzu le bisli li'u
	I express all-of [quote] you walk-on the ice [unquote].
</pre>the meaning would be something like “I say every occurrence of the sentence 'You walk on the ice’”. Of course I don't say every occurrence of it, only some occurrences. One might suppose that <a href=#e6d5>Example 6.5 </a>means that I express exactly one occurrence, but it is more Lojbanic to leave the number unspecified, as with other sumti. We can say definitely, however, that I say it at least once.
<p>
<lx "su'o">  XE "su'o"   The Lojban cmavo meaning “at least” is “su'o”, and if no ordinary number follows, “su'o” means “at least once”. (See <a href=#e6d3>Example 6.3 </a>for the use of “su'o” with an ordinary number). Therefore, the explicitly quantified version of <a href=#e6d5>Example 6.5 </a>is
<p>
<cx "su'o, as implicit quantifier for quotations">  XE "su'o: as implicit quantifier for quotations"   <cx "quotations, implicit quantifier for">  XE “quotation: implicit quantifier for"   <cx "implicit quantifier, for quotations">  XE "implicit quantifier: for quotations"   <pre><a name=e6d7>6.7)	mi cusku su'o lu do cadzu le bisli li'u
	I express at-least-one-of [quote] you walk-on the ice [unquote].
	I say one or more instances of “You walk on the ice”.
	I say “You walk on the ice”.
</pre><p>If an explicit ordinary number such as “re” were to appear, it would have to convey an exact expression, so
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d8>6.8)	mi cusku re lu do cadzu le bisli li'u
	I express two-of [quote] you walk-on the ice [unquote].
</pre>means that I say the sentence exactly twice, neither more nor less.

</pre><cx "quantification, before description sumti compared with before non-description sumti">  XE "quantification: before description sumti compared with before non-description sumti"   Like other sumti, descriptions can be quantified. When a quantifier appears before a description, it has the same meaning as one appearing before a non-description sumti: it specifies how many things, of all those referred to by the description, are being talked about in this particular bridi. Suppose that context tells us that “le gerku” refers to three dogs. Then we can say that exactly two of them are white as follows:
<p>
<ex "two dogs are white">  XE "two dogs are white: example“  <pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	re le gerku cu blabi
	Two-of the dogs are-white.
	Two of the dogs are white.
</pre><cx "outer quantifier, definition">  XE "outer quantifier: definition"   <cx "inner quantifier, definition">  XE "inner quantifier: definition"   <cx "outer quantifier, contrasted with inner quantifier">  XE "outer quantifier: contrasted with inner quantifier"   <cx "inner quantifier, contrasted with outer quantifier">  XE "inner quantifier: contrasted with outer quantifier"   <cx "outer quantifier, effect of on meaning">  XE "outer quantifier: effect of on meaning"   <cx "inner quantifier, effect of on meaning">  XE "inner quantifier: effect of on meaning"   When discussing descriptions, this ordinary quantifier is called an “outer quantifier”, since it appears outside the description. But there is another possible location for a quantifier: between the descriptor and the selbri. This quantifier is called an “inner quantifier”, and its meaning is quite different: it tells the listener how many objects the description selbri characterizes.
<p>
For example, the context of <a href=#e7d1>Example 7.1 </a>supposedly told us that “le gerku” referred to some three specific dogs. This assumption can be made certain with the use of an explicit inner quantifier:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d2>7.2)	re le ci gerku cu blabi
	Two-of the three dogs are-white.
	Two of the three dogs are white.
</pre>(As explained in the discussion of <a href=#e6d3>Example 6.3</a>, simple numbers like those in <a href=#e7d2>Example 7.2 </a>must be exact: it therefore follows that the third dog cannot be white.)
<p>
<cx "inner quantifier, explicit">  XE "inner quantifier: explicit"   You may also specify an explicit inner quantifier and leave the outer quantifier implicit:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d3>7.3)	le ci gerku cu blabi
	The three dogs are-white.
	The three dogs are white.

In fact, there are quite a few regularities in it. First of all, the la-series (that is, the descriptors “la”, “lai”, and “la'i”) and the le-series (that is, the descriptors “le”, “lei”, “le'i”, and “le'e”) always have corresponding implicit quantifiers, so we may subsume the la-series under the le-series for the rest of this discussion: “le-series cmavo” will refer to both the le-series proper and to the la-series.
<p>
<cx "lo-series cmavo, rule for implicit inner quantifier">  XE "lo-series cmavo: rule for implicit inner quantifier"   <cx "le-series cmavo, rule for implicit inner quantifier">  XE "le-series cmavo: rule for implicit inner quantifier"   The rule for the inner quantifier is very simple: the lo-series cmavo (namely, “lo”, “loi”, “lo'i”, and “lo'e”) all have an implicit inner quantifier of “ro”, whereas the le-series cmavo all have an implicit inner quantifier of “su'o”.
<p>
<cx "lo-series cmavo, rationale for implicit inner quantifier">  XE "lo-series cmavo: rationale for implicit inner quantifier"   <cx "le-series cmavo, rationale for implicit inner quantifier">  XE "le-series cmavo: rationale for implicit inner quantifier"   Why? Because lo-series descriptors always refer to all of the things which really fit into the x1 place of the selbri. They are not restricted by the speaker's intention. Descriptors of the le-series, however, are so restricted, and therefore talk about some number, definite or indefinite, of objects the speaker has in mind — but never less than one.
<p>
<cx "sets, rule for implicit outer quantifier">  XE "sets: rule for implicit outer quantifier"   <cx "masses, rule for implicit outer quantifier">  XE "mass: rule for implicit outer quantifier"   <lx "piro">  XE "piro"   Understanding the implicit outer quantifier requires rules of greater subtlety. In the case of mass and set descriptors, a single rule suffices for each: reference to a mass is implicitly a reference to some part of the mass; reference to a set is implicitly a reference to the whole set. Masses and sets are inherently singular objects: it makes no sense to talk about two distinct masses with the same components, or two distinct sets with the same members. Therefore, the largest possible outer quantifier for either a set description or a mass description is “piro”, the whole of it.
<p>
<cx "plural masses, possible use for">  XE "plural masses: possible use for"   (Pedantically, it is possible that the mass of water molecules composing an ice cube might be thought of as different from the same mass of water molecules in liquid form, in which case we might talk about “re lei djacu”, two masses of the water-bits I have in mind.)

<lx "pi">  XE "pi"   <cx "piro, explanation of meaning">  XE "piro: explanation of meaning"   <cx "pisu'o, explanation of meaning">  XE "pisu'o: explanation of meaning"   Why “pi-”? It is the Lojban cmavo for the decimal point. Just as “pimu” means “.5”, and when used as a quantifier specifies a portion consisting of five tenths of a thing, “piro” means a portion consisting of the all-ness – the entirety — of a thing. Similarly, “pisu'o” specifies a portion consisting of at least one part of a thing, i.e. some of it.
<p>
<cx "subsets, expressing with outer quantifiers">  XE "subsets: expressing with outer quantifiers"   <cx "outer quantifiers, for expressing subsets">  XE "outer quantifier: for expressing subset"   <cx "portion, on set contrasted with on individual">  XE "portion: on set contrasted with on individual"   Smaller quantifiers are possible for sets, and refer to subsets. Thus “pimu le'i nanmu” is a subset of the set of men I have in mind; we don't know precisely which elements make up this subset, but it must have half the size of the full set. This is the best way to say “half of the men”; saying “pimu le nanmu” would give us a half-portion of one of them instead! Of course, the result of “pimu le'i nanmu” is still a set; if you need to refer to the individuals of the subset, you must say so (see “lu'a” in <a href=#s10>Section 10</a>).
<p>
<cx "outer quantifiers on individual descriptors, rationale for differences in implicit quantifier">  XE "outer quantifier: rationale for differences in implicit quantifier on descriptors"   <cx "individual descriptors, different implicit outer quantifiers among">  XE "descriptors: different implicit outer quantifiers among"   <cx "le, implicit outer quantifier for">  XE "le: implicit outer quantifier for"   <cx "lo, implicit outer quantifier for">  XE "lo: implicit outer quantifier for"   The case of outer quantifiers for individual descriptors (including “le”, “lo”, “la”, and the typical descriptors “le'e” and “lo'e”) is special. When we refer to specific individuals with “le”, we mean to refer to all of those we have in mind, so “ro” is appropriate as the implicit quantifier, just as it is appropriate for “do”. Reference to non-specific individuals with “lo”, however, is typically to only some of the objects which can be correctly described, and so “su'o” is the appropriate implicit quantifier, just as for quotations.
<p>
<cx "le, contrasted with lo in implicit quantification">  XE "le: contrasted with lo in implicit quantification"   <cx "lo, contrasted with le in implicit quantification">  XE "lo: contrasted with le in implicit quantification"   From the English-speaking point of view, the difference in structure between the following example using “le”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d4>7.4)	[ro] le ci gerku cu blabi
	[All-of] those-described-as three dogs are-white.
	The three dogs are white.
</pre>and the corresponding form with “lo”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d5>7.5)	ci lo [ro] gerku cu blabi
	Three-of those-which-are [all] dogs are-white
	Three dogs are white.
</pre>looks very peculiar. Why is the number “ci” found as an inner quantifier in <a href=#e7d4>Example 7.4 </a>and as an outer quantifier in <a href=#e7d5>Example 7.5</a>? The number of dogs is the same in either case. The answer is that the “ci” in <a href=#e7d4>Example 7.4 </a>is part of the specification: it tells us the actual number of dogs in the group that the speaker has in mind. In <a href=#e7d5>Example 7.5</a>, however, the dogs referred to by “<dots>… </dots>lo gerku” are all the dogs that exist: the outer quantifier then restricts the number to three; which three, we cannot tell. The implicit quantifiers are chosen to avoid claiming too much or too little: in the case of “le”, the implicit outer quantifier “ro” says that each of the dogs in the restricted group is white; in the case of “lo”, the implicit inner quantifier simply says that three dogs, chosen from the group of all the dogs there are, are white.
<p>
<cx "lo-series description, caution on exact numbers as inner quantifiers on">  XE "lo-series description: caution on exact numbers as inner quantifiers on"   Using exact numbers as inner quantifiers in lo-series descriptions is dangerous, because you are stating that exactly that many things exist which really fit the description. So examples like
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d67>7.6)	[su'o] lo ci gerku cu blabi
	[Some-of] those-which-really-are three dogs are-white
</pre>are semantically anomalous; <a href=#e7d7>Example 7.6 </a>claims that some dog (or dogs) is white, but also that there are just three dogs in the universe!
<p>
Nevertheless, inner quantifiers are permitted on “lo” descriptors for consistency's sake, and may occasionally be useful.
<p>
Note that the inner quantifier of “le”, even when exact, need not be truthful: “le ci nanmu” means “what I describe as three men”, not “three of what I describe as men”. This follows from the rule that what is described by a “le” description represents the speaker's viewpoint rather than the objective way things are.
<p>
<a name=s8><h3>Indefinite descriptions</h3>
<p>
<cx "lo, omission of">  XE "lo: omission of"   <cx "descriptors, omission of">  XE "descriptors: omission of"   By a quirk of Lojban syntax, it is possible to omit the descriptor “lo”, but never any other descriptor, from a description like that of <a href=#e7d5>Example 7.5</a>; namely, one which has an explicit outer quantifier but no explicit inner quantifier. The following example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d1>8.1)	ci gerku [ku] cu blabi
	Three dogs are white.
</pre><cx "ku, effect on of omitting descriptor">  XE "ku: effect on of omitting descriptor"   <cx "omission of descriptor, effect on ku">  XE "omission of descriptor: effect on ku"   <cx "indefinite description, definition">  XE "indefinite description: definition"   is equivalent in meaning to <a href=#e7d5>Example 7.5</a>. Even though the descriptor is not present, the elidable terminator “ku” may still be used. The name “indefinite description” for this syntactic form is historically based: of course, it is no more and no less indefinite than its counterpart with an explicit “lo”. Indefinite descriptions were introduced into the language in order to imitate the syntax of English and other natural languages.
<p>
<cx "indefinite description, as needing explicit outer quantifier">  XE "indefinite description: as needing explicit outer quantifier"   <cx "indefinite description, as prohibiting explicit inner quantifier">  XE "indefinite description: as prohibiting explicit inner quantifier"   <cx "outer quantifier, in indefinite description">  XE "outer quantifier: in indefinite description"   <cx "inner quantifier, in indefinite description">  XE "inner quantifier: in indefinite description"   Indefinite descriptions must fit this mold exactly: there is no way to make one which does not have an explicit outer quantifier (thus “*gerku cu blabi” is ungrammatical), or which has an explicit inner quantifier (thus “*reboi ci gerku cu blabi” is also ungrammatical — “re ci gerku cu blabi” is fine, but means “23 dogs are white”).
<p>
Note: <a href=#e6d3>Example 6.3 </a>also contains an indefinite description, namely “su'o ci cutci”; another version of that example using an explicit “lo” would be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d2>8.2)	mi ponse su'o ci lo cutci
	I possess at-least three things-which-really-are shoes
	I own three (or more) shoes.
</pre><a name=s9><h3>sumti-based descriptions</h3>
<p>
As stated in <a href=#s2>Section 2</a>, most descriptions consist of just a descriptor and a selbri. (In this chapter, the selbri have always been single gismu, but of course any selbri, however complex, can be employed in a description. The syntax and semantics of selbri are explained in <a href=chap5.html>Chapter 5</a>.) In the intervening sections, inner and outer quantifiers have been added to the syntax. Now it is time to discuss a description of a radically different kind: the sumti-based description.
<p>
<cx "sumti-based description, definition">  XE "sumti-based description: definition"   <cx "sumti-based description, inner quantifier on">  XE "sumti-based description: inner quantifier on"   <cx "sumti-based description, outer quantifier on">  XE "sumti-based description: outer quantifier on"   A sumti-based description has a sumti where the selbri would normally be, and the inner quantifier is required — it cannot be implicit. An outer quantifier is permitted but not required.
<p>
A full theory of sumti-based descriptions has yet to be worked out. One common case, however, is well understood. Compare the following:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	re do cu nanmu
	Two-of you are-men.
</pre><ex "the two of you">  XE "the two of you: example“  <pre><a name=e9d2>9.2)	le re do cu nanmu
	The two-of you are men.
</pre><a href=#e9d1>Example 9.1 </a>simply specifies that of the group of listeners, size unknown, two are men. <a href=#e9d2>Example 9.2</a>, which has the sumti-based description “le re do”, says that of the two listeners, all (the implicit outer quantifier “ro”) are men. So in effect the inner quantifier “re” gives the number of individuals which the inner sumti “do” refers to.

<p>
Here is another group of examples:
<p>
<ex "three bears">  XE "three bears: example“  <pre><a name=e9d3>9.3)	re le ci cribe cu bunre
	Two-of the three bears are-brown.
<a name=e9d4>9.4)	le re le ci cribe cu bunre
The two-of the three bears are-brown.

</pre><cx "sumti-based descriptions with le, as increasing restricting to in-mind">  XE "sumti-based descriptions with le: as increasing restricting to in-mind"   In each case, “le ci cribe” restricts the bears (or alleged bears) being talked of to some group of three which the speaker has in mind. <a href=#e9d3>Example 9.3 </a>says that two of them (which two is not stated) are brown. <a href=#e9d4>Example 9.4 </a>says that a specific pair of them are brown. <a href=#e9d5>Example 9.5 </a>says that of a specific pair chosen from the original three, one or the other of that pair is brown.

<a name=s10><h3>sumti qualifiers</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<cx "sumti qualifiers, list of">  XE "sumti qualifiers: list of"   <pre>	la'e		LAhE	something referred to by
	lu'e		LAhE	a reference to
	tu'a	LAhE	an abstraction involving
	lu'a		LAhE	an individual/member/component of
	lu'i		LAhE	a set formed from
	lu'o		LAhE	a mass formed from
	vu'i		LAhE	a sequence formed from
	na'ebo	NAhE+BO	something other than
	to'ebo	NAhE+BO	the opposite of
	no'ebo	NAhE+BO	the neutral form of
	je'abo	NAhE+BO	that which indeed is
	lu'u		LUhU	elidable terminator for LAhE and NAhE+BO
</pre><p>Well, that's quite a list of cmavo. What are they all about?
<p>
<cx "LAhE">  XE "LAhE selma’o"   <cx "NAhE">  XE "NAhE selma’o"   <lx "BO">  XE "BO selma’o"   <cx "sumti qualifiers, internal syntax of">  XE "sumti qualifiers: internal syntax of"   <cx "sumti qualifiers, external syntax of">  XE "sumti qualifiers: external syntax of"   <cx "sumti qualifiers, elidable terminator for qualified sumti">  XE "sumti qualifiers: elidable terminator for qualified sumti"   <lx "lu'u">  XE "lu'u"   <cx "lu'u, as elidable terminator for qualified sumti">  XE "lu'u: as elidable terminator for qualified sumti"   The above cmavo and compound cmavo are called the “sumti qualifiers”. All of them are either single cmavo of selma'o LAhE, or else compound cmavo involving a scalar negation cmavo of selma'o NAhE immediately followed by “bo” of selma'o BO. Syntactically, you can prefix a sumti qualifier to any sumti and produce another simple sumti. (You may need to add the elidable terminator “lu'u” to show where the qualified sumti ends.)
<p>
<cx "sumti qualifiers, as short forms for common special cases">  XE "sumti qualifiers: as short forms for common special cases"   Semantically, sumti qualifiers represent short forms of certain common special cases. Suppose you want to say “I see 'The Red Pony’”, where “The Red Pony” is the title of a book. How about:
<p>
<cx "qualified sumti, contrasted with unqualified sumti">  XE "qualified sumti: contrasted with unqualified sumti"   <cx "unqualified sumti, contrasted with qualified sumti">  XE "unqualified sumti: contrasted with qualified sumti"   <ex "Red Pony">  XE "Red Pony: example“  <pre><a name=e10d1>10.1)	mi viska lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u
	I see [quote] the red small-horse [unquote]
</pre><p>But <a href=#e10d1>Example 10.1 </a>doesn't work: it says that you see a piece of text “The Red Pony”. That might be all right if you were looking at the cover of the book, where the words “The Red Pony” are presumably written. (More precisely, where the words “le xunre cmaxirma” are written – but we may suppose the book has been translated into Lojban.)
<p>
What you really want to say is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d2>10.2)	mi viska le selsinxa be lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u
	I see the thing-represented-by [quote] the red small-horse [unquote]
</pre><p>The x2 place of “selsinxa” (the x1 place of “sinxa”) is a sign or symbol, and the x1 place of “selsinxa” (the x2 place of “sinxa”) is the thing represented by the sign. <a href=#e10d2>Example 10.2 </a>allows us to use a symbol (namely the title of a book) to represent the thing it is a symbol of (namely the book itself).
<p>
This operation turns out to be needed often enough that it's useful to be able to say:
<p>
<cx "la'e, as short for “le selsinxa be”">  XE "la'e: as short for \“le selsinxa be\”"   <pre><a name=e10d3>10.3)	mi viska la'e lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u [lu'u]
	I see the-referent-of [quote] the red small-horse [unquote].
</pre><cx "dereferencing a pointer, with la'e">  XE "dereferencing a pointer: with la'e"   <cx "la'e, effect of on meaning">  XE "la'e: effect of on meaning"   <cx "referent, referring to with la'e">  XE "referent: referring to with la'e"   <lx "la'e">  XE "la'e"   So when “la'e” is prefixed to a sumti referring to a symbol, it produces a sumti referring to the referent of that symbol. (In computer jargon, “la'e” dereferences a pointer.)
<p>
By introducing a sumti qualifier, we correct a false sentence (<a href=#e10d1>Example 10.1</a>), which too closely resembles its literal English equivalent, into a true sentence (<a href=#e10d3>Example 10.3</a>), without having to change it overmuch; in particular, the structure remains the same. Most of the uses of sumti qualifiers are of this general kind.
<p>
<lx "lu'e">  XE "lu'e"   <cx "lu'e, effect of on meaning">  XE "lu'e: effect of on meaning"   <cx "symbol, referring to with lu'e">  XE "symbol: referring to with lu'e"   The sumti qualifier “lu'e” provides the converse operation: it can be prefixed to a sumti referring to some thing to produce a sumti referring to a sign or symbol for the thing. For example,
<p>
<cx "lu'e, as short for “le sinxa be”">  XE "lu'e: as short for \“le sinxa be\”"   <ex "title of book">  XE "title of book: example“  <pre><a name=e10d4>10.4)	mi pu cusku lu'e le vi cukta
	I [past] express a-symbol-for the nearby book.
	I said the title of this book.
</pre><p>The equivalent form not using a sumti qualifier would be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d5>10.5)	mi pu cusku le sinxa be le vi cukta
	I [past] express the symbol-for the nearby book.
</pre>which is equivalent to <a href=#e10d4>Example 10.4</a>, but longer.
<p>
<lx "tu'a">  XE "tu'a"   <lx "lu'a">  XE "lu'a"   <lx "lu'i">  XE "lu'i"   <lx "lu'o">  XE "lu'o"   <lx "vu'i">  XE "vu'i"   <cx "tu'a, effect of on meaning">  XE "tu'a: effect of on meaning"   <cx "lu'a, effect of on meaning">  XE "lu'a: effect of on meaning"   <cx "lu'i, effect of on meaning">  XE "lu'i: effect of on meaning"   <cx "lu'o, effect of on meaning">  XE "lu'o: effect of on meaning"   <cx "vu'i, effect of on meaning">  XE "vu'i: effect of on meaning"   <cx "tu'a, use for forming abstractions">  XE "tu'a: use for forming abstractions"   <cx "vu'i, use for creating sequence">  XE "vu'i: use for creating sequence"   <cx "sequence, contrasted with set">  XE "sequence: contrasted with set"   The other sumti qualifiers follow the same rules. The cmavo “tu'a” is used in forming abstractions, and is explained more fully in <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11</a>. The triplet “lu'a”, “lu'i”, and “lu'o” convert between individuals, masses, and sets; “vu'i” belongs to this group as well, but creates a sequence, which is similar to a set but has a definite order. (The set of John and Charles is the same as the set of Charles and John, but the sequences are different.) Here are some examples:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d6>10.6)	mi troci tu'a le vorme
	I try some-abstraction-about the door.
	I try (to open) the door.
</pre><cx "tu'a, as being deliberately vague">  XE "tu'a: as being deliberately vague"   <a href=#e10d6>Example 10.6 </a>might mean that I try to do something else involving the door; the form is deliberately vague.
<p>
Most of the following examples make use of the cmavo “ri”, belonging to selma'o KOhA. This cmavo means “the thing last mentioned”; it is equivalent to repeating the immediately previous sumti (but in its original context). It is explained in more detail in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7</a>.

<p>
<ex "set of rats">  XE "set of rats: example“  <pre><a name=e10d7>10.7)	lo'i ratcu cu barda  .iku'i lu'a ri cmalu
	The-set-of rats is-large.  But some-members-of it-last-mentioned is-small.
	The set of rats is large, but some of its members are small.
<a name=e10d8>10.8)	lo ratcu cu cmalu  .iku'i lu'i ri barda
	Some rats are-small.  But the-set-of them-last-mentioned is-large.
	Some rats are small, but the set of rats is large.
<a name=e10d9>10.9)	mi ce do girzu
		.i lu'o ri gunma
		.i vu'i ri porsi
	I in-a-set-with you are-a-set.
		The-mass-of it-last-mentioned is-a-mass.
		The-sequence-of it-last-mentioned is-a-sequence
	The set of you and me is a set.
		The mass of you and me is a mass.
		The sequence of you and me is a sequence.
</pre>(Yes, I know these examples are a bit silly. This set was introduced for completeness, and practical examples are as yet hard to come by.)
<p>
<cx "sumti qualifiers, for negation">  XE "sumti qualifiers: for negation"   <cx "negation sumti qualifiers, meanings of">  XE "negation sumti qualifiers: meanings of"   Finally, the four sumti qualifiers formed from a cmavo of NAhE and “bo” are all concerned with negation, which is discussed in detail in <a href=chap15.html>Chapter 15</a>. Here are a few examples of negation sumti qualifiers:
<p>
<lx "na'ebo">  XE "na'ebo"   <pre><a name=e10d10>10.10)	mi viska na'ebo le gerku
	I see something-other-than the dog.
</pre><p>This compound, “na'ebo”, is the most common of the four negation sumti qualifiers. The others usually only make sense in the context of repeating, with modifications, something already referred to:
<p>
<ex "lukewarm food">  XE "lukewarm food: example“  <pre><a name=e10d11>10.11)	mi nelci loi glare cidja
		.ije do nelci to'ebo ri
		.ije la djein. nelci no'ebo ra
	I like part-of-the-mass-of hot-type-of food.
		And you like the-opposite-of the-last-mentioned.
		And Jane likes the-neutral-value-of something-mentioned.
	I like hot food, and you like cold food, and Jane likes lukewarm food.
</pre>(In <a href=#e10d11>Example 10.11</a>, the sumti “ra” refers to some previously mentioned sumti other than that referred to by “ri”. We cannot use “ri” here, because it would signify “la djein.”, that being the most recent sumti available to “ri”. See more detailed explanations in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7</a>.)
<p>
<a name=s11><h3>The syntax of vocative phrases</h3>
<p>
<cx "vocative phrases, as a “free modifier”">  XE "vocative phrase: as a free modifier"   Vocative phrases are not sumti, but are explained in this chapter because their syntax is very similar to that of sumti. Grammatically, a vocative phrase is one of the so-called “free modifiers” of Lojban, along with subscripts, parentheses, and various other constructs explained in <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19</a>. They can be placed after many, but not all, constructions of the grammar: in general, after any elidable terminator (which, however, must not then be elided!), at the beginnings and ends of sentences, and in many other places.
<p>
<cx "vocative phrase, purpose of">  XE "vocative phrase: purpose of"   <lx "COI">  XE "COI selma’o"   <lx "DOI">  XE "DOI selma’o"   The purpose of a vocative phrase is to indicate who is being addressed, or to indicate to that person that he or she ought to be listening. A vocative phrase begins with a cmavo of selma'o COI or DOI, all of which are explained in more detail in <a href=chap13.html>Chapter 13</a>. Sometimes that is all there is to the phrase:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d1>11.1)	coi
	[greetings]
	Hello.
<a name=e11d2>11.2)	je'e
	[acknowledgement]
	Uh-huh.
	Roger!
</pre><cx "vocative word, phrase following">In these cases, the person being addressed is obvious from the context. However, a vocative word (more precisely, one or more cmavo of COI, possibly followed by “doi”, or else just “doi” by itself) can be followed by one of several kinds of phrases, all of which are intended to indicate the addressee. The most common case is a name:
<p>
<lx "coi">  XE "coi"   <pre><a name=e11d2>11.2)	coi. djan.
	Hello, John.
</pre><p>A pause is required (for morphological reasons) between a member of COI and a name. You can use “doi” instead of a pause:
<p>
<lx "doi">  XE "doi"   <pre><a name=e11d3>11.3)	coi doi djan.
	Hello, John.
</pre>means exactly the same thing and does not require a pause. Using “doi” by itself is like just saying someone's name to attract his or her attention:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d4>11.4)	doi djan.
	John!
</pre><cx "vocative phrase, forms of">  XE "vocative phrase: forms of"   <cx "vocative phrase, with sumti without descriptor">  XE "vocative phrase: with sumti without descriptor"   <cx "vocative phrase, implicit descriptor on">  XE "vocative phrase: implicit descriptor on"   In place of a name, a description may appear, lacking its descriptor, which is understood to be “le”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d5>11.5)	coi xunre pastu nixli
	Hello, (red-type-of dress)-type-of girl.
	Hello, girl with the red dress!
</pre><cx "vocative phrase, implicit quantifiers on">  XE "vocative phrase: implicit quantifiers on"   <cx "vocative phrase, explicit quantifiers prohibited on">  XE "vocative phrase: explicit quantifiers prohibited on"   The listener need not really be a “xunre pastu nixli”, as long as she understands herself correctly from the description. (Actually, only a bare selbri can appear; explicit quantifiers are forbidden in this form of vocative, so the implicit quantifiers “su'o le ro” are in effect.)
<p>
Finally, a complete sumti may be used, the most general case.
<p>
<cx "vocative phrase, with complete sumti">  XE "vocative phrase: with complete sumti"   <pre><a name=e11d6>11.6)	co'o la bab. .e la noras.
	Goodbye, Bob and Nora.
</pre><a href=#e11d5>Example 11.5 </a>is thus the same as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d7>11.7)	coi le xunre pastu nixli
	Hello, the-one-described-as red-dress girl!
</pre>and <a href=#e11d4>Example 11.4 </a>is the same as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d8>11.8)	doi la djan.
	The-one-named John!
</pre><cx "vocative phrase, elidable terminator for">  XE "vocative phrase: elidable terminator for"   <lx "do'u">  XE "do'u"   <lx "DOhU">  XE "DOhU selma’o"   <cx "vocative phrase terminator, elidability of">  XE "vocative phrase terminator: elidability of"   Finally, the elidable terminator for vocative phrases is “do'u” (of selma'o DOhU), which is rarely needed except when a simple vocative word is being placed somewhere within a bridi. It may also be required when a vocative is placed between a sumti and its relative clause, or when there are a sequence of so-called “free modifiers” (vocatives, subscripts, utterance ordinals — see <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18 </a>— metalinguistic comments — see <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19 </a>— or reciprocals — see <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19</a>) which must be properly separated.
<p>
<cx "vocative phrase, effect of position on meaning">  XE "vocative phrase: effect of position on meaning"   The meaning of a vocative phrase that is within a sentence is not affected by its position in the sentence: thus <a href=#e11d9>Example 11.9 </a>and <a href=#e11d10>Example 11.10 </a>mean the same thing:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d9>11.9)	doi djan. ko klama mi
	John, come to me!
<a name=e11d10>11.10)	ko klama mi doi djan.
	Come to me, John!
</pre><p>As usual for this chapter, the full syntax of vocative phrases has not been explained: relative clauses, discussed in <a href=chap8.html>Chapter 8</a>, make for more possibilities.
<p>
<a name=s12><h3>Lojban names</h3>
<p>
Names have been used freely as sumti throughout this chapter without too much explanation. The time for the explanation has now come.
<p>
<cx "names, two kinds of">  XE "names: two kinds of"   <cx "name words, recognition of">  XE "name words: recognition of"   First of all, there are two different kinds of things usually called “names” when talking about Lojban. The naming predicates of <a href=#s2>Section 2 </a>are just ordinary predicates which are being used in a special sense. In addition, though, there is a class of Lojban words which are used only to name things: these can be recognized by the fact that they end in a consonant followed by a pause. Some examples:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d1>12.1)	djan.	meris.	djein.	.alis.
	John.	Mary.	Jane.	Alice.
</pre>(Note that “.alis.” begins as well as ends with a pause, because all Lojban words beginning with a vowel must be preceded by a pause. See <a href=chap4.html>Chapter 4 </a>for more information.)
<p>
<cx "names, uses of">  XE "names: uses of"   <cx "names, in vocative phrase">  XE "names: in vocative phrase"   <cx "names, with LA descriptor">  XE "names: with LA descriptor"   Names of this kind have two basic uses in Lojban: when used in a vocative phrase (see <a href=#s11>Section 11</a>) they indicate who the listener is or should be. When used with a descriptor of selma'o LA, namely “la”, “lai”, or “la'i”, they form sumti which refer to the persons or things known by the name.
<p>
<lx "la">  XE "la"   <pre><a name=e12d2>12.2)	la djonz. klama le zarci
	Jones goes to-the store.
	The Joneses go to-the store.
</pre><lx "lai">  XE "lai"   <pre><a name=e12d3>12.3)	lai djonz. klama le zarci
	The-mass-of Joneses go to-the store.
	The Joneses go to the store.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e12d2>Example 12.2</a>, the significance is that all the persons (perhaps only one) I mean to refer to by the name “djonz.” are going to the store. In <a href=#e12d3>Example 12.3</a>, the Joneses are massified, and only some part of them needs to be going. Of course, by “djonz.” I can mean whomever I want: that person need not use the name “djonz.” at all.
<p>
<cx "LE, contrasted with LA in use of name-words">  XE "LE selma’o: contrasted with LA in use of name-words"   <cx "LA, contrasted with LE in use of name-words">  XE "LA selma’o: contrasted with LE in use of name-words"   The sumti in <a href=#e12d2>Example 12.2 </a>and <a href=#e12d3>Example 12.3 </a>operate exactly like the similar uses of “la” and “lai” in <a href=#e2d{5}>Examples 2.5 </a>and <a href=#e3d6>3.6 </a>respectively. The only difference is that these descriptors are followed by Lojban name-words. And in fact, the only difference between descriptors of selma'o LA (these three) and of selma'o LE (all the other descriptors) is that the former can be followed by name-words, whereas the latter cannot.
<p>
<cx "name-words, limitations on">  XE "name-words: limitations on"   <cx "name-words, pause requirements before">  XE "name-words: pause requirements before"   <cx "LA, effect on necessity for pause before name-word">  XE "LA selma’o: effect on necessity for pause before name-word"   <cx "doi, effect on necessity for pause before name-word">  XE "doi: effect on necessity for pause before name-word"   <lx "doi">  XE "doi"   <lx "LA">  XE "LA selma’o"   <lx "la">  XE "la"   <lx "lai">  XE "lai"   <lx "la'i">  XE "la'i"   There are certain limitations on the form of name-words in Lojban. In particular, they cannot contain the letter-sequences (or sound-sequences) “la”, “lai”, or “doi” unless a consonant immediately precedes within the name. Reciprocally, every name not preceded by “la”, “lai”, “la'i”, or “doi” must be preceded by a pause instead:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d4>12.4)	coi .djan.
	Hello, John.
<a name=e12d5>12.5)	zo .djan. cmene mi
	The-word “John” is-the-name-of me.
	My name is John.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e12d4>Example 12.4 </a>and <a href=#e12d5>Example 12.5</a>, “.djan.” appears with a pause before it as well as after it, because the preceding word is not one of the four special cases. These rules force names to always be separable from the general word-stream.
<p>
<cx "names, multiple">  XE "names: multiple"   Unless some other rule prevents it (such as the rule that “zo” is always followed by a single word, which is quoted), multiple names may appear wherever one name is permitted, each with its terminating pause:
<p>
<ex "Newport News">  XE "Newport News: example“  <ex "John Paul Jones">  XE "John Paul Jones: example“  <pre><a name=e12d6>12.6)	doi djan. pol. djonz. le bloti cu klama fi la niuport. niuz.
	John Paul Jones, the boat comes (to somewhere) from Newport News.
</pre><cx "name-words, permissible consonant combinations">  XE "name-words: permissible consonant combinations"   A name may not contain any consonant combination that is illegal in Lojban words generally: the “impermissible consonant clusters” of Lojban morphology (explained in <a href=chap3.html>Chapter 3</a>). Thus “djeimz.” is not a valid version of “James” (because “mz” is invalid): “djeimyz” will suffice. Similarly, “la” may be replaced by “ly”, “lai” by “ly'i”, “doi” by “do'i” or “dai”. Here are a few examples:
<p>
<pre>    English name	invalid Lojban name	valid Lojban names
</pre><ex "Lottie">  XE "Lottie: example“  <ex "Lyra">  XE "Lyra: example“  <ex "Doyle">  XE "Doyle: example“  <pre> 	Doyle		       *doi,l		   do'il or dai,l
	Lyra		       *lairas		   ly'iras
	Lottie 		       *latis		   LYtis. or lotis.
(American pronunciation)
</pre><cx "names, using rafsi">  XE "names: using rafsi"   Names may be borrowed from other languages or created arbitrarily. Another common practice is to use one or more rafsi, arranged to end with a consonant, to form a name: thus the rafsi “loj-” for “logji” (logical) and “ban-” for “bangu” (language) unite to form the name of this language:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d7>12.7)	lojban.
	Lojban
</pre><cx "names, borrowing from other languages">  XE "names: borrowing from other languages"   <cx "names from vowel-final base, commonly used consonant endings">  XE "names from vowel-final base: commonly used consonant endings"   When borrowing names from another language which end in a vowel, or when turning a Lojban brivla (all of which end in vowels) into a name, the vowel may be removed or an arbitrary consonant added. It is common (but not required) to use the consonants “s” or “n” when borrowing vowel-final names from English; speakers of other languages may wish to use other consonant endings.
<p>
<cx "names with la, implicit quantifier for">  XE "names with la: implicit quantifier for"   The implicit quantifier for name sumti of the form “la” followed by a name is “su'o”, just as for “la” followed by a selbri.
<p>
<a name=s13><h3>Pro-sumti summary</h3>
<p>
<cx "pro-sumti, classes of">  XE "pro-sumti: classes of"   The Lojban pro-sumti are the cmavo of selma'o KOhA. They fall into several classes: personal, definable, quantificational, reflexive, back-counting, indefinite, demonstrative, metalinguistic, relative, question. More details are given in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7</a>; this section mostly duplicates information found there, but adds material on the implicit quantifier of each pro-sumti.
<p>
<cx "pro-sumti, implicit quantifier for">  XE "pro-sumti: implicit quantifier for"   <lx "ro">  XE "ro"   The following examples illustrate each of the classes. Unless otherwise noted below, the implicit quantification for pro-sumti is “ro” (all). In the case of pro-sumti which refer to other sumti, the “ro” signifies “all of those referred to by the other sumti”: thus it is possible to restrict, but not to extend, the quantification of the other sumti.
<p>
<cx "personal pro-sumti">  XE "personal pro-sumti"   Personal pro-sumti (“mi”, “do”, “mi'o”, “mi'a”, “ma'a”, “do'o”, “ko”) refer to the speaker or the listener or both, with or without third parties:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d1>13.1)	mi prami do
	I love you.
</pre><cx "personal pro-sumti, implicit quantifier for">  XE "personal pro-sumti: implicit quantifier for"   The personal pro-sumti may be interpreted in context as either representing individuals or masses, so the implicit quantifier may be “pisu'o” rather than “ro”: in particular, “mi'o”, “mi'a”, “ma'a”, and “do'o” specifically represent mass combinations of the individuals (you and I, I and others, you and I and others, you and others) that make them up.
<p>
<cx "definable pro-sumti">  XE "definable pro-sumti"   Definable pro-sumti (“ko'a”, “ko'e”, “ko'i”, “ko'o”, “ko'u”, “fo'a”, “fo'e”, “fo'i”, “fo'o”, “fo'u”) refer to whatever the speaker has explicitly made them refer to. This reference is accomplished with “goi” (of selma'o GOI), which means “defined-as”.
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d2>13.2)	le cribe goi ko'a cu xekri  .i ko'a citka le smacu
	The bear defined-as it-1 is-black.  It-1 eats the mouse.
</pre><cx "quantificational pro-sumti">  XE "quantificational pro-sumti"   Quantificational pro-sumti (“da”, “de”, “di”) are used as variables in bridi involving predicate logic:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d3>13.3)	ro da poi prenu cu prami pa de poi finpe
	All somethings-1 which-are persons love one something-2 which-is a-fish.
	All persons love a fish (each his/her own).
</pre><cx "quantificational pro-sumti, implicit quantification rules">  XE "quantificational pro-sumti: implicit quantification rules"   (This is not the same as “All persons love a certain fish”; the difference between the two is one of quantifier order.) The implicit quantification rules for quantificational pro-sumti are particular to them, and are discussed in detail in <a href=chap16.html>Chapter 16</a>. Roughly speaking, the quantifier is “su'o” (at least one) when the pro-sumti is first used, and “ro” (all) thereafter.
<p>
<cx "reflexive pro-sumti">  XE "reflexive pro-sumti"   Reflexive pro-sumti (“vo'a”, “vo'e”, “vo'i”, “vo'o”, “vo'u”) refer to the same referents as sumti filling other places in the same bridi, with the effect that the same thing is referred to twice:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d4>13.4)	le cribe cu batci vo'a
	The bear bites what-is-in-the-x1-place.
	The bear bites itself.
</pre><cx "back-counting pro-sumti">  XE "back-counting pro-sumti"   Back-counting pro-sumti (“ri”, “ra”, “ru”) refer to the referents of previous sumti counted backwards from the pro-sumti:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d5>13.5)	mi klama la frankfurt. ri
	I go to-Frankfurt from-the-referent-of-the-last-sumti
	I go from Frankfurt to Frankfurt (by some unstated route).
</pre><cx "indefinite pro-sumti">  XE "indefinite pro-sumti"   Indefinite pro-sumti (“zo'e”, “zu'i”, “zi'o”) refer to something which is unspecified:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d6>13.6)	mi klama la frankfurt. zo'e zo'e zo'e
	I go to-Frankfurt from-unspecified via-unspecified by-means-unspecified.
</pre><cx "indefinite pro-sumti, implicit quantifier for">  XE "indefinite pro-sumti: implicit quantifier for"   The implicit quantifier for indefinite pro-sumti is, well, indefinite. It might be “ro” (all) or “su'o” (at least one) or conceivably even “no” (none), though “no” would require a very odd context indeed.
<p>
<cx "demonstrative pro-sumti">  XE "demonstrative pro-sumti"   Demonstrative pro-sumti (“ti”, “ta”, “tu”) refer to things pointed at by the speaker, or when pointing is not possible, to things near or far from the speaker:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d7>13.7)	ko muvgau 
ti ta tu
	You [imperative] move 
this-thing from-that-nearby-place to-that-further-away-place.
	Move this from there to over there!
</pre><cx "metalinguistic pro-sumti">  XE "metalinguistic pro-sumti"   Metalinguistic pro-sumti (“di'u”, “de'u”, “da'u”, “di'e”, “de'e”, “da'e”, “dei”, “do'i”) refer to spoken or written utterances, either preceding, following, or the same as the current utterance.
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d8>13.8)	li re su'i re du li vo
		.i la’edi'u jetnu
	The-number two plus two equals the-number four.
		The-previous-utterance is-true.
</pre><cx "metalinguistic pro-sumti, implicit quantifier for">  XE "metalinguistic pro-sumti: implicit quantifier for"   The implicit quantifier for metalinguistic pro-sumti is “su'o” (at least one), because they are considered analogous to “lo” descriptions: they refer to things which really are previous, current, or following utterances.
<p>
<cx "relative pro-sumti">  XE "relative pro-sumti"   The relative pro-sumti (“ke'a”) is used within relative clauses (see <a href=chap8.html>Chapter 8 </a>for a discussion of relative clauses) to refer to whatever sumti the relative clause is attached to.
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d9>13.9)	mi viska le mlatu ku poi zo'e zbasu ke'a

	I see the cat(s) such-that something-unspecified makes it/them (the cats)
		from-a-mass-of plastic.
	I see the cat(s) made of plastic.
</pre><cx "question pro-sumti">  XE "question pro-sumti"   The question pro-sumti (“ma”) is used to ask questions which request the listener to supply a sumti which will make the question into a truth:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d10>13.10)	do klama ma
	You go to-what-sumti?
	Where are you going?
</pre><cx "question pro-sumti, implicit quantifier for">  XE "question pro-sumti: implicit quantifier for"   The implicit quantifier for the question pro-sumti is “su'o” (at least one), because the listener is only being asked to supply a single answer, not all correct answers.
<p>
<cx "definable pro-sumti, sequences of lerfu words as">  XE "definable pro-sumti: sequences of lerfu words as"   In addition, sequences of lerfu words (of selma'o BY and related selma'o) can also be used as definable pro-sumti.
<p>
<a name=s14><h3>Quotation summary</h3>
<p>
<cx "quotation, four kinds">  XE "quotation: four kinds"   There are four kinds of quotation in Lojban: text quotation, words quotation, single-word quotation, non-Lojban quotation. More information is provided in <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19</a>.
<p>
<cx "text quotation, syntax of">  XE "text quotation: syntax of"   <cx "text quotation, as internally grammatical">  XE "text quotation: as internally grammatical"   <lx "lu">  XE "lu"   <lx "li'u">  XE "li'u"   Text quotations are preceded by “lu” and followed by “li'u”, and are an essential part of the surrounding text: they must be grammatical Lojban texts.
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d1>14.1)	mi cusku lu mi'e djan. li'u
	I say the-text [quote] I-am John [unquote].
	I say “I'm John”.
</pre><cx "word quotation, as morphologically valid">  XE "word quotation: as morphologically valid"   <cx "word quotation, internal grammar of">  XE "word quotation: internal grammar of"   Words quotations are quotations of one or more Lojban words. The words need not mean anything, but they must be morphologically valid so that the end of the quotation can be discerned.
<p>
<lx "lo'u">  XE "lo'u"   <lx "le'u">  XE "le'u"   <pre><a name=e14d2>14.2)	mi cusku lo'u li mi le'u
	I say the-words [quote] “li mi” [unquote].
	I say “li mi”.
</pre><p>Note that the translation of <a href=#e14d2>Example 14.2 </a>does not translate the Lojban words, because they are not presumed to have any meaning (in fact, they are ungrammatical).
<p>
<cx "single-word quotation">  XE "single-word quotation"   Single-word quotation quotes a single Lojban word. Compound cmavo are not allowed.
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d3>14.3)	mi cusku zo .ai
	I say the-word “.ai”.
</pre><cx "non-Lojban quotation">  XE "non-Lojban quotation"   Non-Lojban quotation can quote anything, Lojban or not, even non-speech such as drum talk, whistle words, music, or belching. A Lojban word which does not appear within the quotation is used before and after it to set it off from the surrounding Lojban text.
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d4>14.4)	mi cusku zoi kuot. I'm John .kuot
	I say “I'm John”.
</pre><cx "quotation, implicit quantifier for">  XE "quotation: implicit quantifier for"   The implicit quantifier for all types of quotation is “su'o” (at least one), because quotations are analogous to “lo” descriptions: they refer to things which actually are words or sequences of words.
<p>
<a name=s15><h3>Number summary</h3>
<p>
<cx "number sumti, syntax of">  XE "number sumti: syntax of"   <cx "number sumti, with li">  XE "number sumti: with li"   <lx "li">  XE "li"   The sumti which refer to numbers consist of the cmavo “li” (of selma'o LI) followed by an arbitrary Lojban mekso, or mathematical expression. This can be anything from a simple number up to the most complicated combination of numbers, variables, operators, and so on. Much more information on numbers is given in <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18</a>. Here are a few examples of increasing complexity:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d1>15.1)	li vo
	the-number four
	4
<a name=e15d2>15.2)	li re su'i re
	the-number two plus two
	<math>2 + 2</math>
<a name=e15d3>15.3)	li .abu bopi'i xy. bote'a re su'i by. bopi'i xy. su'i cy.
	the-number a times x to-power 2 plus b times x plus c
	<math>ax<sup>2</sup>+ bx + c</math>
</pre><cx "number sumti, with me'o">  XE "number sumti: with me'o"   <cx "me'o">  XE "me'o"   <cx "LI">  XE "LI selma’o"   <cx "number sumti, with me'o contrasted with li">  XE "number sumti: with me'o contrasted with li"   <cx "number sumti, with li contrasted with me'o">  XE "number sumti: with li contrasted with me'o"   An alternative to “li” is “me'o”, also of selma'o LI. Number expressions beginning with “me'o” refer to the actual expression, rather than its value. Thus <a href=#e15d1>Example 15.1 </a>and <a href=#e15d2>Example 15.2 </a>above have the same meaning, the number four, whereas
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d4>15.4)	me'o vo
	the-expression four
	“4”
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d5>15.5)	me'o re su'i re
	the-expression two plus two
	“2+2”
</pre>refer to different pieces of text.
<p>
<cx "numbers, implicit quantifier for">  XE "numbers: implicit quantifier for"   <cx "mathematical expressions, implicit quantifier for">  XE "mathematical expressions: implicit quantifier for"   The implicit quantifier for numbers and mathematical expressions is “su'o”, because these sumti are analogous to “lo” descriptions: they refer to things which actually are numbers or pieces of text. In the case of numbers (with “li”), this is a distinction without a difference, as there is only one number which is 4; but there are many texts “4”, as many as there are documents in which that numeral appears.

Brevity Is The Soul Of Language: Pro-sumti And Pro-bridi</h2>
<h6>$Revision: 4.0 $<br>

<p>
<a name=s1><h3>What are pro-sumti and pro-bridi? What are they for?</h3>
<p>
<cx "pronouns in English, as noun abbreviations">  XE "pronouns in English: as noun abbreviations"   Speakers of Lojban, like speakers of other languages, require mechanisms of abbreviation. If every time we referred to something, we had to express a complete description of it, life would be too short to say what we have to say. In English, we have words called “pronouns” which allow us to replace nouns or noun phrases with shorter terms. An English with no pronouns might look something like this:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	Speakers of Lojban, like speakers of other languages, require mechanisms of
abbreviation. If every time speakers of Lojban referred to a thing to which
	speakers of Lojban refer, speakers of Lojban had to express a complete
description of what speakers of Lojban referred to, life would be too short to
say what speakers of Lojban have to say.
</pre><cx "pronouns in English, as independent of abbreviations">  XE "pronouns in English: as independent of abbreviations"   Speakers of this kind of English would get mightily sick of talking. Furthermore, there are uses of pronouns in English which are independent of abbreviation. There is all the difference in the world between:
<p>
<ex "shook stick">  XE "shook stick: example“  <pre><a name=e1d2>1.2)	John picked up a stick and shook it.
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d3>1.3)	John picked up a stick and shook a stick.
</pre><a href=#e1d3>Example 1.3 </a>does not imply that the two sticks are necessarily the same, whereas <a href=#e1d2>Example 1.2 </a>requires that they are.

<cx "pronouns, compared to pro-sumti in usage as abbreviations">  XE "pronouns: compared to pro-sumti in usage as abbreviations"   <cx "pro-sumti, compared to pronouns in usage as abbreviations">  XE "pro-sumti: compared to pronouns in usage as abbreviations"   <cx "pro-sumti, definition">  XE "pro-sumti: definition"   <cx "pro-bridi, definition">  XE "pro-bridi: definition"   <lx "KOhA">  XE "KOhA selma’o"   <lx "GOhA">  XE "GOhA selma’o"   <cx "pro-bridi, compared to pro-sumti as means of abbreviation">  XE "pro-bridi: compared to pro-sumti as means of abbreviation"   <cx "pro-sumti, compared to pro-bridi as means of abbreviation">  XE "pro-sumti: compared to pro-bridi as means of abbreviation"   <cx "pro-sumti, series">  XE "pro-sumti: series"   In Lojban, we have sumti rather than nouns, so our equivalent of pronouns are called by the hybrid term “pro-sumti”. A purely Lojban term would be “sumti cmavo”: all of the pro-sumti are cmavo belonging to selma'o KOhA. In exactly the same way, Lojban has a group of cmavo (belonging to selma'o GOhA) which serve as selbri or full bridi. These may be called “pro-bridi” or “bridi cmavo”. This chapter explains the uses of all the members of selma'o KOhA and GOhA. They fall into a number of groups, known as series: thus, in selma'o KOhA, we have among others the mi-series, the ko'a-series, the da-series, and so on. In each section, a series of pro-sumti is explained, and if there is a corresponding series of pro-bridi, it is explained and contrasted. Many pro-sumti series don't have pro-bridi analogues, however.
<p>
<cx "referent of pro-sumti, definition">  XE "referent of pro-sumti: definition"   <cx "antecedent of pro-sumti, definition">  XE "antecedent of pro-sumti: definition"   <cx "referent of pro-bridi, definition">  XE "referent of pro-bridi: definition"   <cx "antecedent of pro-bridi, definition">  XE "antecedent of pro-bridi: definition"   A few technical terms: The term “referent” means the thing to which a pro-sumti (by extension, a pro-bridi) refers. If the speaker of a sentence is James, then the referent of the word “I” is James. On the other hand, the term “antecedent” refers to a piece of language which a pro-sumti (or pro-bridi) implicitly repeats. In
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d4>1.4)	John loves himself
</pre>the antecedent of “himself” is “John”; not the person, but a piece of text (a name, in this case). John, the person, would be the referent of “himself”. Not all pro-sumti or pro-bridi have antecedents, but all of them have referents.
<p>
<a name=s2><h3>Personal pro-sumti: the mi-series</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	mi	KOhA	mi-series	I, me
	do	KOhA	mi-series	you
	mi'o	KOhA	mi-series	you and I

Neither “mi” nor “do” is specific about the number of persons referred to; for example, the foreman of a jury may refer to the members of the jury as “mi”, since in speaking officially he represents all of them.
<p>
<cx "COI, effect on referent of “mi”">  XE "COI selma’o: effect on referent of mi"   <cx "COI, effect on referent of “do”">  XE "COI selma’o: effect on referent of do"   <lx "mi'e">  XE "mi'e"   <lx "COI">  XE "COI selma’o"   The referents of “mi” and “do” are usually obvious from the context, but may be assigned by the vocative words of selma'o COI, explained in <a href=chap13.html>Chapter 13</a>. The vocative “mi'e” assigns “mi”, whereas all of the other vocatives assign “do”.
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	mi'e djan. doi frank. mi cusku lu mi bajra li'u do

<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>“mi'o” includes only the speaker and the listener but no one else;
“mi'a” includes the speaker and others but excludes the listener;
<p><dt><dd>“do'o” includes the listener and others but excludes the speaker;

</dl><cx "pro-sumti for speaker/listener/others, relation to joi">  XE "pro-sumti for speaker/listener/others: relation to joi"   <cx "pro-sumti for speaker/listener/others, as masses">  XE "pro-sumti for speaker/listener/others: as masses"   All of these pro-sumti represent masses. For example, “mi'o” is the same as “mi joi do”, the mass of me and you considered jointly.
<p>
<cx "English “we”, contrasted with Lojban pro-sumti for “we”">  XE "English we: contrasted with Lojban pro-sumti for we"   <cx "pro-sumti for “we”, contrasted with English “we”">  XE "pro-sumti for we: contrasted with English we"   In English, “we” can mean “mi” or “mi'o” or “mi'a” or even “ma'a”, and English-speakers often suffer because they cannot easily distinguish  “mi'o” from “mi'a”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d2>2.2)	We're going to the store.
</pre><p>Does this include the listener or not? There's no way to be sure.
<p>
<lx "ko">  XE "ko"   <cx "commands, with ko">  XE "commands: with ko"   <cx "imperatives, with ko">  XE "imperatives: with ko"   <cx "ko, use for imperatives">  XE "ko: use for imperatives"   <cx "ko, use for commands">  XE "ko: use for commands"   Finally, the cmavo “ko” is logically equivalent to “do”; its referent is the listener. However, its use alters an assertion about the listener into a command to the listener to make the assertion true:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d3>2.3)	do klama le zarci
	You go to-the store.
</pre>becomes:

<p>
<pre><a name=e2d4>2.4)	ko klama le zarci
	You [imperative] go to-the store.
	Make “you go to the store” true!
	Go to the store!
</pre><cx "imperatives, English contrasted with Lojban in presence of subject of command">  XE "imperatives: English contrasted with Lojban in presence of subject of command"   <cx "ko, in later selbri place in imperative">  XE "ko: in later selbri place in imperative"   In English, the subject of a command is omitted, but in Lojban, the word “ko” must be used. However, “ko” does not have to appear in the x1 place:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d5>2.5)	mi viska ko
	I see you [imperative]
	Make “I see you” true!
	Be seen by me!
</pre><cx "ko, in sub-clause of main bridi">  XE "ko: in sub-clause of main bridi"   In <a href=#e2d5>Example 2.5</a>, it is necessary to make the verb passive in English in order to convey the effect of “ko” in the x2 place. Indeed, “ko” does not even have to be a sumti of the main bridi:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d6>2.6)	mi viska le prenu poi prami ko
	I see the person that loves you [imperative]
	Make “I see the person that loves you” true!
	Be such that the person who loves you is seen by me!
	Show me the person who loves you!
</pre><cx "mi-series pro-sumti, lack of pro-bridi equivalent">  XE "mi-series pro-sumti: lack of pro-bridi equivalent"   As mentioned in <a href=#s1>Section 1</a>, some pro-sumti series have corresponding pro-bridi series. However, there is no equivalent of the mi-series among pro-bridi, since a person isn't a relationship.
<p>
<a name=s3><h3>Demonstrative pro-sumti: the ti-series</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	ti	KOhA	ti-series	this here, a nearby object
	ta	KOhA	ti-series	that there, a medium-distant object
	tu	KOhA	ti-series	that yonder, a far-distant object

In English, the words “this” and “that” serve this function among others: “this” refers to something pointed at that is near the speaker, and “that” refers to something further away. The Lojban pro-sumti of the ti-series serve the same functions, but more narrowly. The cmavo “ti”, “ta”, and “tu” provide only the pointing function of “this” and “that”; they are not used to refer to things that cannot be pointed at.
<p>
<cx "yon, as archaic English equivalent of tu">  XE "yon: as archaic English equivalent of tu"   <cx "tu, archaic English yon as equivalent of">  XE "tu: archaic English yon as equivalent of"   <cx "ti-series pro-sumti, 3 degrees of distance with">  XE "ti-series pro-sumti: 3 degrees of distance with"   There are three pro-sumti of the ti-series rather than just two because it is often useful to distinguish between objects that are at more than two different distances. Japanese, among other languages, regularly does this. Until the 16th century, English did too; the pronoun “that” referred to something at a medium distance from the speaker, and the now-archaic pronoun “yon” to something far away.
<p>
<cx "ti-series pro-sumti, conversational convention for">  XE "ti-series pro-sumti: conversational convention for"   <cx "ti-series pro-sumti, problems in written text">  XE "ti-series pro-sumti: problems in written text"   In conversation, there is a special rule about “ta” and “tu” that is often helpful in interpreting them. When used contrastingly, “ta” refers to something that is near the listener, whereas “tu” refers to something far from both speaker and listener. This makes for a parallelism between “ti” and “mi”, and “ta” and “do”, that is convenient when pointing is not possible; for example, when talking by telephone. In written text, on the other hand, the meaning of the ti-series is inherently vague; is the writer to be taken as pointing to something, and if so, to what? In all cases, what counts as “near” and “far away” is relative to the current situation.

<pre> 	di'u	KOhA	di'u-series	the previous utterance
	de'u	KOhA	di'u-series	an earlier utterance
	da'u	KOhA	di'u-series	a much earlier utterance

</pre><cx "pro-sumti for utterances">  XE "pro-sumti for utterances"   <cx "utterance pro-sumti (see also di'u-series pro-sumti)">  XE "utterance pro-sumti (see also di'u-series pro-sumti)"   <cx "di'u-series pro-sumti">  XE "di'u-series pro-sumti /r dihuseries   <cx "this, as utterance reference in English">  XE "this: as utterance reference in English"   <cx "pro-sumti, di'u-series">  XE "pro-sumti: di'u-series" /r dihuseries   The cmavo of the di'u-series enable us to talk about things that have been, are being, or will be said. In English, it is normal to use “this” and “that” for this (indeed, the immediately preceding “this” is an example of such a usage):
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d1>4.1)	You don't like cats.
	That is untrue.
</pre><p>Here “that” does not refer to something that can be pointed to, but to the preceding sentence “You don't like cats”. In Lojban, therefore, <a href=#e4d1>Example 4.1 </a>is rendered:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d2>4.2)	do na nelci loi mlatu  .i di'u jitfa jufra
	You (Not!) like the-mass-of cats.  The-previous-utterance is-a-false-sentence.
</pre><cx "ta, contrasted with di'u">  XE "ta: contrasted with di'u"   <cx "di'u, contrasted with ta">  XE "di'u: contrasted with ta"   <cx "ti-series pro-sumti, contrasted with di'u-series pro-sumti">  XE "ti-series pro-sumti: contrasted with di'u-series pro-sumti"   Using “ta” instead of “di'u” would cause the listener to look around to see what the speaker of the second sentence was physically pointing to.
<p>
<lx "di'u">  XE "di'u"   <lx "de'u">  XE "de'u"   <lx "da'u">  XE "da'u"   As with “ti”, “ta”, and “tu”, the cmavo of the di'u-series come in threes: a close utterance, a medium-distance utterance, and a distant utterance, either in the past or in the future. It turned out to be impossible to use the “i”/“a”/“u” vowel convention of the demonstratives in <a href=#s3>Section 3 </a>without causing collisions with other cmavo, and so the di'u-series has a unique “i”/“e”/“a” convention in the first vowel of the cmavo.
<p>
<lx "di'e">  XE "di'e"   <lx "de'e">  XE "de'e"   <lx "da'e">  XE "da'e"   Most references in speech are to the past (what has already been said), so “di'e”, “de'e”, and “da'e” are not very useful when speaking. In writing, they are frequently handy:
<p>
<ex "Simon says">  XE "Simon says: example“  <pre><a name=e4d3>4.3)	la saimn. cusku di'e
	Simon expresses the-following-utterance.
	Simon says:
</pre><a href=#e4d3>Example 4.3 </a>would typically be followed by a quotation. Note that although presumably the quotation is of something Simon has said in the past, the quotation utterance itself would appear after <a href=#e4d3>Example 4.3</a>, and so “di'e” is appropriate.
<p>
<lx "dei">  XE "dei"   <lx "do'i">  XE "do'i"   The remaining two cmavo, “dei” and “do'i”, refer respectively to the very utterance that the speaker is uttering, and to some vague or unspecified utterance uttered by someone at some time:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d4>4.4)	dei jetnu jufra
	This-utterance is-a-true-sentence.
	What I am saying (at this moment) is true.
<a name=e4d5>4.5)	do'i jetnu jufra
	Some-utterance is-a-true-sentence.
	That's true (where “that” is not necessarily what was just said).
The cmavo of the di'u-series have a meaning that is relative to the context. The referent of “dei” in the current utterance is the same as the referent of “di'u” in the next utterance. The term “utterance” is used rather than “sentence” because the amount of speech or written text referred to by any of these words is vague. Often, a single bridi is intended, but longer utterances may be thus referred to.
<p>
<lx "la'e">  XE "la'e"   <lx "LAhE">  XE "LAhE selma’o"   <lx "la'edi'u">  XE "la'edi'u"   Note one very common construction with “di'u” and the cmavo “la'e” (of selma'o LAhE; see <a href=chap6.html>Chapter 6</a>) which precedes a sumti and means “the thing referred to by (the sumti)”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d6>4.6)	mi prami la djein.  .i mi nelci la'e di'u
	I love Jane. And I like the-referent-of the-last-utterance.
	I love Jane, and I like that.
<cx "di'u, contrasted with la'edi'u">  XE "di'u: contrasted with la'edi'u"   <cx "la'edi'u, contrasted with di'u">  XE "la'edi'u: contrasted with di'u"   The effect of “la'e di'u” in <a href=#e4d6>Example 4.6 </a>is that the speaker likes, not the previous sentence, but rather the state of affairs referred to by the previous sentence, namely his loving Jane. This cmavo compound is often written as a single word: “la'edi'u”. It is important not to mix up “di'u” and “la'edi'u”, or the wrong meaning will generally result:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d7>4.7)	mi prami la djein.  .i mi nelci di'u
	I love Jane. And I like the-last-utterance.
</pre>says that the speaker likes one of his own sentences.
<p>
There are no pro-bridi corresponding to the di'u-series.

In English, the personal pronouns include not only “I” and “you” but also “he”, “she”, “it”, and “they”. Lojban does have equivalents of this latter group: in fact, it has more of them than English does. However, they are organized and used very differently.
<p>
<cx "personal pronouns for he/she/it/they, English contrasted with Lojban in organization">  XE "personal pronouns for he/she/it/they: English contrasted with Lojban in organization"   <cx "ko'a-series pro-sumti, as assignable">  XE "ko'a-series pro-sumti: as assignable"   There are ten cmavo in the ko'a-series, and they may be assigned freely to any sumti whatsoever. The English word “he” can refer only to males, “she” only to females (and ships and a few other things), “it” only to inanimate things, and “they” only to plurals; the cmavo of the ko'a-series have no restrictions at all. Therefore, it is almost impossible to guess from the context what ko'a-series cmavo might refer to if they are just used freely:
<p>
<lx "ko'a">  XE "ko'a"   <pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	la .alis. klama le zarci  .i ko'a blanu
	Alice goes-to the store.  It-1 is-blue.
</pre><p>The English gloss “it-1”, plus knowledge about the real world, would tend to make English-speakers believe that “ko'a” refers to the store; in other words, that its antecedent is “le zarci”. To a Lojbanist, however, “la .alis.” is just as likely an antecedent, in which case <a href=#e5d1>Example 5.1 </a>means that Alice, not the store, is blue.
<p>
<lx "goi">  XE "goi"   <cx "ko'a-series pro-sumti, assigning with goi">  XE "ko'a-series pro-sumti: assigning with goi"   To avoid this pitfall, Lojban employs special syntax, using the cmavo “goi”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d2>5.2)	la .alis. klama le zarci  .i ko'a goi la .alis. cu blanu
	Alice goes-to the store.  It-1, also-known-as Alice, is-blue.
</pre><cx "ko'a-series pro-sumti, assignment with goi as symmetrical">  XE "ko'a-series pro-sumti: assignment with goi as symmetrical"   Syntactically, “goi la .alis.” is a relative phrase (relative phrases are explained in <a href=chap8.html>Chapter 8</a>). Semantically, it says that “ko'a” and “la .alis.” refer to the same thing, and furthermore that this is true because “ko'a” is being defined as meaning “la .alis.”. It is equally correct to say:

<p>
<pre><a name=e5d3>5.3)	la .alis. klama le zarci  .i la .alis. goi ko'a cu blanu
	Alice goes-to the store.  Alice, also-known-as it-1, is-blue.
</pre><lx "ge'u">  XE "ge'u"   in other words, “goi” is symmetrical. There is a terminator, “ge'u” (of selma'o GEhU), which is almost always elidable. The details are in <a href=chap8.html>Chapter 8</a>.
<p>
<cx "goi assignment of ko'a-series pro-sumti, use in speech contrasted with writing">  XE "goi assignment of ko'a-series pro-sumti: use in speech contrasted with writing"   The afterthought form of “goi” shown in <a href=#e5d2>Example 5.2 </a>and <a href=#e5d3>Example 5.3 </a>is probably most common in speech, where we do not know until part way through our utterance that we will want to refer to Alice again. In writing, though, “ko'a” may be assigned at the point where Alice is first mentioned. An example of this forethought form of “goi” is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d4>5.4)	la .alis. goi ko'a klama le zarci  .i ko'a cu blanu
	Alice, also-known-as it-1, goes-to the store.  It-1 is-blue.
</pre><ex "legal jargon">  XE "legal jargon: example“  <ex "hereafter known as">  XE "hereafter known as: example“  Again, “ko'a goi la .alis.” would have been entirely acceptable in <a href=#e5d4>Example 5.4</a>.

<p>

The cmavo “cei” performs the role of “goi” in assigning “broda” to this long phrase, and “broda” can then be used just like any other brivla. (In fact, “broda” and its relatives actually <i>are </i>brivla: they are gismu in morphology, although they behave exactly like the members of selma'o GOhA. The reasons for using gismu rather than cmavo are buried in the Loglan Project's history.)
<p>
<cx "antecedent, for pro-bridi as full bridi">  XE "antecedent: for pro-bridi as full bridi"   Note that pro-bridi are so called because, even though they have the grammar of selbri, their antecedents are whole bridi. In the following rather contrived example, the antecedent of “brode” is the whole bridi “mi klama le zarci”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d6>5.6)	mi klama cei brode le zarci  .i do brode
	I go-to (which-is claim-1) the store. You claim-1
	I go to the store. You, too.
</pre><cx "pro-bridi, overriding sumti of antecedent bridi for">  XE "pro-bridi: overriding sumti of antecedent bridi for"   In the second bridi, “do brode” means “do klama le zarci”, because “brode” carries the x2 sumti of “mi klama le zarci” along with it. It also potentially carries the x1 sumti as well, but the explicit x1 sumti “do” overrides the “mi” of the antecedent bridi. Similarly, any tense or negation that is present in the antecedent is also carried, and can be overridden by explicit tense or negation cmavo on the pro-bridi. These rules hold for all pro-bridi that have antecedents.

The main difference between letter pro-sumti and ko'a-series pro-sumti is that, in the absence of an explicit assignment, letters are taken to refer to the most recent name or description sumti beginning with the same letter:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d8>5.8)	mi viska le gerku  .i gy. cusku zo arf.

In the English translation, we use the same principle to refer to the dog as “D”. Of course, in case of ambiguity, “goi” can be used to make an explicit assignment.
<p>
<cx "goi, use in assigning name">  XE "goi: use in assigning name"   <cx "name, assigning with goi">  XE "names: assigning with goi"   Furthermore, “goi” can even be used to assign a name:

	The woman also-known-as Sam goes to-the store.
	The woman, whom I'll call Sam, goes to the store.
</pre><p>This usage does not imply that the woman's name is Sam, or even that the speaker usually calls the woman “Sam”. “Sam” is simply a name chosen, as if at random, for use in the current context only.

Lojban provides three pro-sumti anaphora, “ri”, “ra”, and “ru”; and three corresponding pro-bridi anaphora, “go'i”, “go'a”, and “go'u”. These cmavo reveal the same vowel pattern as the ti-series, but the “distances” referred to are not physical distances, but distances from the anaphoric cmavo to its antecedent.
<p>
<lx "ri">  XE "ri"   <cx "ri, referent of">  XE "ri: referent of"   The cmavo “ri” is the simplest of these; it has the same referent as the last complete sumti appearing before the “ri”:

</pre><cx "ri-series pro-sumti, effect of use on meaning">  XE "ri-series pro-sumti: effect of use on meaning"   The “ri” in <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1 </a>is equivalent to repeating the last sumti, which is “la .alis.”, so <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1 </a>is equivalent to:

This prevents “ri” from getting entangled in paradoxes of self-reference. (There are plenty of other ways to do that!) Note also that sumti within other sumti, as in quotations, abstractions, and the like, are counted in the order of their beginnings; thus a lower level sumti like “la alis.” in <a href=#e6d2>Example 6.2 </a>is considered to be more recent than a higher level sumti that contains it.

It is simpler just to repeat these directly:
<p>

Likewise, “ri” itself (or rather its antecedent) can be repeated by a later “ri”; in fact, a string of “ri” cmavo with no other intervening sumti always all repeat the same sumti:
<p>

</pre><p>Here “rixire”, or “ri-sub-2”, skips “la rik.” to reach “lo forca”. In the same way, “riximu”, or “ri-sub-5”, skips “la .alis.”, “rixire”, “la rik.”, and “lo forca” to reach “lo smuci”. As can clearly be seen, this procedure is barely practicable in writing, and would break down totally in speech.

The cmavo “ra” repeats a recently used sumti, and “ru” one that was further back in the speech or text. The use of “ra” and “ru” forces the listener to guess at the referent, but makes life easier for the speaker. Can “ra” refer to the last sumti, like “ri”? The answer is no if “ri” has also been used. If “ri” has not been used, then “ra” might be the last sumti. Likewise, if “ra” has been used, then any use of “ru” would repeat a sumti earlier than the one “ra” is repeating. A more reasonable version of Example 6.5, but one that depends more on context, is:

<p>
<pre><a name=e6d6>6.6)	lo smuci .i lo forca .i la rik. pilno ra
		.i la .alis. pilno ru
	A spoon. A fork. Rick uses [some previous thing].
		Alice uses [some more remote thing].
</pre><p>In <a href=#e6d6>Example 6.6</a>, the use of “ra” tells us that something other than “la rik.” is the antecedent; “lo forca” is the nearest sumti, so it is probably the antecedent. Similarly, the antecedent of “ru” must be something even further back in the utterance than “lo forca”, and “lo smuci” is the obvious candidate.
<p>
<cx "ri-series pro-sumti, assigning for permanent reference">  XE "ri-series pro-sumti: assigning for permanent reference"   <lx "goi">  XE "goi"   The meaning of “ri” must be determined every time it is used. Since “ra” and “ru” are more vaguely defined, they may well retain the same meaning for a while, but the listener cannot count on this behavior. To make a permanent reference to something repeated by “ri”, “ra”, or “ru”, use “goi” and a ko'a-series cmavo:

Any bridi that are embedded within other bridi, such as relative clauses or abstractions, are not counted. Like the cmavo of the broda-series, the cmavo of the go'i-series copy all sumti with them. This makes “go'i” by itself convenient for answering a question affirmatively, or for repeating the last bridi, possibly with new sumti:
<p>

</pre><p>Here B's sentence repeats A's within an abstraction (explained in Chapter 11): “le si'o mi go'i” means “le si'o mi klama le zarci”. Why must B use the word “mi” explicitly to replace the x1 of “mi klama le zarci”, even though it looks like “mi” is replacing “mi”? Because B's “mi” refers to B, whereas A's “mi” refers to A. If B said:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d11>6.11)	mi nelci le si'o go'i

</dl><cx "go'i-series pro-bridi, as repeating referent concept">  XE "go'i-series pro-bridi: as repeating referent concept"   The repetition signalled by “go'i” is not literally of words, but of concepts. Finally, A repeats her own sentence, but with the x1 changed to “do”, meaning B. Note that in <a href=#e6d10>Example 6.10</a>, the tense “ba” (future time) is carried along by both “go'i” and “go'e”.

They repeat respectively some future bridi, the current bridi, and the bridi that encloses the current bridi (“no'a”, unlike the other members of the go'i- series, can repeat non-sentence bridi). Here are a few examples:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d13>6.13)	mi nupre le nu mi go'o

	I promise to do the following:
		Give the money to my son.

</pre>(Note: The Lojban does not contain an equivalent of the “my” in the colloquial English; it leaves the fact that it is the speaker's son and daughter that are referred to implicit. To make the fact explicit, use “le bersa/tixnu be mi”.)
<p>
For good examples of “nei” and “no'a”, we need nested bridi contexts:

Normally, any pro-sumti used within the antecedent of the pro-bridi keep their meanings intact. In the presence of “ra'o”, however, their meanings must be reinterpreted with reference to the new environment. If someone says to you:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d16>6.16)	mi ba lumci lemi karca
	I will wash my car.
</pre>you might reply either:
<p>

	I will wash your car.
</pre>or:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d18>6.18)	mi go'i ra'o
	I will wash my car.
</pre><p>The “ra'o” forces the second “mi” from the original bridi to mean the new speaker rather than the former speaker. This means that “go'e ra'o” would be an acceptable alternative to “do go'e” in B's statement in <a href=#e6d10>Example 6.10</a>.

The cmavo “zo'e” represents an elliptical value for this sumti place; it is the optional spoken place holder when a sumti is skipped without being specified. Note that the elliptical value is not always the typical value. The properties of ellipsis lead to an elliptical sumti being defined as “whatever I want it to mean but haven't bothered to figure out, or figure out how to express”.
<p>
<lx "zu'i">  XE "zu'i"   <cx "pro-sumti, typical">  XE "pro-sumti: typical"   <cx "typical sumti">  XE "typical sumti"   The cmavo “zu'i”, on the other hand, represents the typical value for this place of this bridi:

		zu'i zu'i
	I go to-the outside of the house from-the inside of the house
		[by-typical-route] [by-typical-means]
</pre><p>In <a href=#e7d1>Example 7.1</a>, the first “zu'i” probably means something like “by the door”, and the second “zu'i” probably means something like “on foot”, those being the typical route and means for leaving a house. On the other hand, if you are at the top of a high rise during a fire, neither “zu'i” is appropriate. It's also common to use “zu'i” in “by standard” places.

When a bridi fills one of its places with “zi'o”, what is really meant is that the selbri has a place which is irrelevant to the true relationship the speaker wishes to express. For example, the place structure of “zbasu” is
<p>
<dl compact><dt>zbasu:  <dd>actor x1 makes x2 from materials x3
</dl><ex "living things">  XE "living things: example“  Consider the sentence

	The-mass-of living-things is-made [by-something] from the-mass-of cells
</pre>because the “zo'e”, expressed or understood, in <a href=#e7d2>Example 7.2 </a>indicates that there is still a “maker” in this relationship. We do not generally suppose, however, that someone “makes” living things from cells. The best answer is probably to find a different selbri, one which does not imply a “maker”: however, an alternative strategy is to use “zi'o” to eliminate the maker place:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d3>7.3)	loi jmive cu se zbasu zi'o loi selci
	The-mass-of living-things is-made [without-maker] from the-mass-of cells.
</pre><cx "zi'o, as creating new selbri">  XE "zi'o: as creating new selbri"   Note: The use of “zi'o” to block up, as it were, one place of a selbri actually creates a new selbri with a different place structure. Consider the following examples:
<p>

Lojban grammar does not allow the speaker to merely omit a selbri from a bridi, although any or all sumti may be freely omitted. Being vague about a relationship requires the use of “co'e” as a selbri place-holder:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d8>7.8)	mi troci le nu mi co'e le vorme
	I try the event-of my [doing-the-obvious-action] to-the door.
	I try the door.
</pre><p>The English version means, and the Lojban version probably means, that I try to open the door, but the relationship of opening is not actually specified; the Lojbanic listener must guess it from context. Lojban, unlike English, makes it clear that there is an implicit action that is not being expressed.
<p>
<cx "co'e, rationale for word form">  XE "co'e: rationale for word form"   The form of “co'e” was chosen to resemble “zo'e”; the cmavo “do'e” of selma'o BAI (see <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>) also belongs to the same group of cmavo.

Constructions using “soi” are free modifiers, and as such can go almost anywhere. Here is an example where “se'u” is required:

</pre><a name=s9><h3>sumti and bridi questions: “ma” and “mo”</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	ma	KOhA	sumti question
	mo	GOhA	bridi question
</pre><lx "ma">  XE "ma"   <cx "ma, as sumti question">  XE "ma: as sumti question"   <cx "questions, sumti">  XE "questions: sumti"   Lojban questions are more fully explained in <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19 </a>, but “ma” and “mo” are listed in this chapter for completeness. The cmavo “ma” asks for a sumti to make the bridi true:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	do klama ma
	You go to-what-destination?
	Where are you going?
</pre><lx "mo">  XE "mo"   <cx "mo, as selbri question">  XE "mo: as selbri question"   <cx "questions, selbri">  XE "questions: selbri"   <cx "mo, compared with go'i in overriding of arguments">  XE "mo: compared with go'i in overriding of arguments"   <cx "go'i, compared with mo in overriding of arguments">  XE "go'i: compared with mo in overriding of arguments"   The cmavo “mo”, on the other hand, asks for a selbri which makes the question bridi true. If the answer is a full bridi, then the arguments of the answer override the arguments in the question, in the same manner as the go'i-series cmavo. A simple example is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d2>9.2)	do mo
	What predicate is true as applied to you?
	How are you?
	What are you doing?
	What are you?
</pre><a href=#e9d2>Example 9.2 </a>is a truly pregnant question that will have several meanings depending on context.
<p>
(One thing it probably does not mean is “Who are you?” in the sense “What is your name/identity?”, which is better expressed by:
<p>
<ex "what is your name">  XE "what is your name: example“  <pre><a name=e9d3>9.3)	ma cmene do
	What sumti is-the-name-of you?
	What is your name?
</pre>or even
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d4>9.4)	doi ma
	O [what sumti?]
</pre>which uses the vocative “doi” to address someone, and simultaneously asks who the someone is.)
<p>
A further example of “mo”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d5>9.5)	lo mo prenu cu darxi do  .i barda
	A [what selbri?] type-of person hit you?  (Observative:) A big thing.
	Which person hit you? The big one.

<p>
<ex "who knows what">  XE "who knows what: example“  <pre><a name=e9d6>9.6)	ma djuno ma
	[What sumti] knows [what sumti]?

<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:

</pre><lx "ke'a">  XE "ke'a"   <cx "pro-sumti, for relativized sumti in relative clauses">  XE "pro-sumti: for relativized sumti in relative clauses"   <cx "ke'a, for relativized sumti in relative clauses">  XE "ke'a: for relativized sumti in relative clauses"     XE "ke'a: for relativized sumti in relative clauses"   <cx "relative clauses, use of ke'a for referral to relativized sumti in">  XE “relative clause: use of ke'a for referral to relativized sumti in"   This pro-sumti is used in relative clauses (explained in <a href=chap8.html>Chapter 8</a>) to indicate how the sumti being relativized fits within the clause. For example:
<p>
<ex "cat of plastic">  XE "cat of plastic: example“  <pre><a name=e10d1>10.1)	mi catlu lo mlatu poi [zo'e] zbasu

	I see a cat made of plastic.

</pre><cx "ke'a, ambiguity when omitted">  XE "ke'a: ambiguity when omitted"   If “ke'a” were omitted from <a href=#e10d1>Example 10.1</a>, it might be confused with:
<p>

</pre><cx "ke'a, contrasted with ri in relative clauses">  XE "ke'a: contrasted with ri in relative clauses"   <cx "ri, contrasted with ke'a in relative clauses">  XE "ri: contrasted with ke'a in relative clauses"   The anaphora cmavo “ri” cannot be used in place of “ke'a” in <a href=#e10d1>Example 10.1 </a>and <a href=#e10d2>Example 10.2</a>, because the relativized sumti is not yet complete when the “ke'a” appears.
<p>
<cx "ke'a, and abstract descriptions">  XE "ke'a: and abstract descriptions"   <cx "ke'a, subscripting for nested relative clauses">  XE "ke'a: subscripting for nested relative clauses"   <cx "subscripts, on ke'a for nested relative clauses">  XE "subscripts: on ke'a for nested relative clauses"   Note that “ke'a” is used only with relative clauses, and not with other embedded bridi such as abstract descriptions. In the case of relative clauses within relative clauses, “ke'a” may be subscripted to make the difference clear (see <a href=chap8.html>Chapter 8</a>).
<p>
<a name=s11><h3>Abstraction focus pro-sumti: “ce'u”</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	ce'u	KOhA	abstraction focus
</pre><lx "ce'u">  XE "ce'u"   The cmavo “ce'u” is used within abstraction bridi, particularly property abstractions introduced by the cmavo “ka”. Abstractions, including the uses of “ce'u”, are discussed in full in <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11</a>.
<p>
<cx "property abstraction, specifying sumti place of property with ce'u">  XE "property abstraction(s): specifying sumti place of property with ce'u"   <cx "ce'u, use in specifying sumti place of property in abstraction">  XE "ce'u: use in specifying sumti place of property in abstraction"   In brief: Every property abstraction specifies a property of one of the sumti in it; that sumti place is filled by using “ce'u”. This convention enables us to distinguish clearly between:
<p>
<ex "happiness">  XE "happiness: example“  <pre><a name=e11d1>11.1)	le ka ce'u gleki
	the property-of (X being-happy)
	the property of being happy

</pre>and

</pre><a name=s13><h3>Pro-sumti and pro-bridi cancelling</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	da'o	DAhO	cancel all pro-sumti/pro-bridi
</pre><cx "pro-sumti assignment, stability of">  XE "pro-sumti assignment: stability of"   <cx "pro-bridi assignment, stability of">  XE "pro-bridi assignment: stability of"   How long does a pro-sumti or pro-bridi remain stable? In other words, once we know the referent of a pro-sumti or pro-bridi, how long can we be sure that future uses of the same cmavo have the same referent? The answer to this question depends on which series the cmavo belongs to.
<p>
<cx "personal pro-sumti, implicit cancellation of by change of speaker/listener">  XE "personal pro-sumti: implicit cancellation of by change of speaker/listener"   <cx "personal pro-sumti, stability of">  XE "personal pro-sumti: stability of"   <cx "assignable pro-sumti, stability of">  XE "assignable pro-sumti: stability of"   <cx "assignable pro-sumti, explicit cancellation of by rebinding">  XE "assignable pro-sumti: explicit cancellation of by rebinding"   <lx "goi">  XE "goi"   <lx "cei">  XE "cei"   <cx "bound variable pro-sumti, stability of">  XE "bound variable pro-sumti: stability of"   Personal pro-sumti are stable until there is a change of speaker or listener, possibly signaled by a vocative. Assignable pro-sumti and pro-bridi last indefinitely or until rebound with “goi” or “cei”. Bound variable pro-sumti and pro-bridi also generally last until re-bound; details are available in <a href=chap16.html>Chapter 16</a>.
<p>
<cx "utterance pro-sumti, stability of">  XE "utterance pro-sumti: stability of"   <cx "reflexive pro-sumti, stability of">  XE "reflexive pro-sumti: stability of"   <cx "ke'a, stability of">  XE "ke'a: stability of"   <cx "anaphoric pro-sumti, stability of">  XE "anaphoric pro-sumti: stability of"   <cx "anaphoric pro-bridi, stability of">  XE "anaphoric pro-bridi: stability of"   Utterance pro-sumti are stable only within the utterance in which they appear; similarly, reflexive pro-sumti are stable only within the bridi in which they appear; and “ke'a” is stable only within its relative clause. Anaphoric pro-sumti and pro-bridi are stable only within narrow limits depending on the rules for the particular cmavo.
<p>
<cx "demonstrative pro-sumti, stability of">  XE "demonstrative pro-sumti: stability of"   <cx "indefinite pro-sumti, stability of">  XE "indefinite pro-sumti: stability of"   <cx "indefinite pro-bridi, stability of">  XE "indefinite pro-bridi: stability of"   Demonstrative pro-sumti, indefinite pro-sumti and pro-bridi, and sumti and bridi questions potentially change referents every time they are used.
<p>
<cx "pro-sumti assignment, explicit cancellation of with da'o">  XE "pro-sumti assignment: explicit cancellation of with da'o"   <cx "pro-bridi assignment, explicit cancellation of with da'o">  XE "pro-bridi assignment: explicit cancellation of with da'o"   <lx "da'o">  XE "da'o"   <lx "DAhO">  XE "DAhO selma’o"   <cx "cancellation of pro-sumti/pro-bridi assignment, with da'o">  XE "cancellation of pro-sumti/pro-bridi assignment: with da'o"   <cx "da'o, for cancellation of pro-sumti/pro-bridi assignment">  XE "da'o: for cancellation of pro-sumti/pro-bridi assignment"   <cx "da'o, syntax of">  XE "da'o: syntax of"   However, there are ways to cancel all pro-sumti and pro-bridi, so that none of them have known referents. (Some, such as “mi”, will acquire the same referent as soon as they are used again after the cancellation.) The simplest way to cancel everything is with the cmavo “da'o” of selma'o DAhO, which is used solely for this purpose; it may appear anywhere, and has no effect on the grammar of texts containing it. One use of “da'o” is when entering a conversation, to indicate that one's pro-sumti assignments have nothing to do with any assignments already made by other participants in the conversation.

<cx "ni'o, effect on pro-sumti/pro-bridi assignments">  XE "ni'o: effect on pro-sumti/pro-bridi assignments"   <cx "no'i, effect on pro-sumti/pro-bridi assignments">  XE "no'i: effect on pro-sumti/pro-bridi assignments"   <cx "pro-sumti assignments, no'i effect on">  XE "pro-sumti assignment: no'i effect on"   <cx "pro-bridi assignments, no'i effect on">  XE "pro-bridi assignment: no'i effect on"   In addition, the cmavo “ni'o” and “no'i” of selma'o NIhO, which are used primarily to indicate shifts in topic, may also have the effect of canceling pro-sumti and pro-bridi assignments, or of reinstating ones formerly in effect. More explanations of NIhO can be found in <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19</a>.
<p>
<a name=s14><h3>The identity predicate: du</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	du	GOhA	identity
</pre><cx "identity predicate">  XE "identity predicate"   <lx "du">  XE "du"   The cmavo “du” has the place structure:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>du:  <dd>x1 is identical with x2, x3, <dots>…</dots>
</dl><cx "du, rationale for selection of selma'o for">  XE "du: rationale for selection of selma'o for"   and appears in selma'o GOhA for reasons of convenience: it is not a pro-bridi. “du” serves as mathematical “=”, and outside mathematical contexts is used for defining or identifying. Mathematical examples may be found in <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18</a>.

<p>
<cx "du, contrasted with mintu">  XE "du: contrasted with mintu"   <cx "mintu, contrasted with du">  XE "mintu: contrasted with du"   The main difference between
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d1>14.1)	ko'a du le nanmu

</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d2>14.2)	ko'a mintu le nanmu
	It-1 is-the-same-as the man
</pre><cx "du, meaning of">  XE "du: meaning of"   is this defining nature. <a href=#e14d1>Example 14.1 </a>presumes that the speaker is responding to a request for information about what “ko'a” refers to, or that the speaker in some way feels the need to define “ko'a” for later reference. A bridi with “du” is an identity sentence, somewhat metalinguistically saying that all attached sumti are representations for the same referent. There may be any number of sumti associated with “du”, and all are said to be identical.
<p>
<a href=#e14d2>Example 14.2</a>, however, predicates; it is used to make a claim about the identity of “ko'a”, which presumably has been defined previously.
<p>
<cx "du, derivation of">  XE "du: derivation of"   <cx "du, contrasted with dunli">  XE "du: contrasted with dunli"   <cx "dunli, contrasted with du">  XE "dunli: contrasted with du"   Note: “du” historically is derived from “dunli”, but “dunli” has a third place which “du” lacks: the standard of equality.
<p>
<a name=s15><h3>lujvo based on pro-sumti</h3>
<p>
<cx "rafsi, based on pro-sumti">  XE "rafsi: based on pro-sumti"   <cx "pro-sumti, rafsi for">  XE "pro-sumti: rafsi for"   There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA, but they are rarely used. (See <a href=#s16>Section 16 </a>for a complete list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand as the first rafsi in their lujvo.
<p>
<ex "you-talk">  XE "you-talk: example“  <cx "lujvo, pro-sumti rafsi effect on place structure of">  XE "lujvo: pro-sumti rafsi effect on place structure of"   <cx "pro-sumti rafsi, effect of on place structure of lujvo">  XE "pro-sumti rafsi: effect of on place structure of lujvo"   Thus “donta'a”, meaning “you-talk”, would be interpreted as “tavla be do”, and would have the place structure
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d1>15.1)	t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
</pre>since t2 (the addressee) is already known to be “do”.
<p>
<ex "you-cmavo">  XE "you-cmavo: example“  On the other hand, the lujvo “donma'o”, literally “you-cmavo”, which means “a second person personal pronoun”, would be interpreted as “cmavo be zo do”, and have the place structure:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d2>15.2)	c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
</pre>since both the c2 place (the grammatical class) and the c3 place (the meaning) are obvious from the context “do”.
<p>
<cx "pro-sumti rafsi, anticipated use of for abbreviating inconvenient forms">  XE "pro-sumti rafsi: anticipated use of for abbreviating inconvenient forms"   <lx "fo'a">  XE "fo'a"   An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the “fo'a” series is to express lujvo which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An example would be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d3>15.3)	fo'a goi le kulnrsu,omi  .i lo fo'arselsanga
	x6 stands for Finnish-culture.  An x6-song.
</pre><ex "beverage">  XE "beverage: example“  <lx "zi'o">  XE "zi'o"   <cx "lujvo, zi'o rafsi effect on place structure of">  XE "lujvo: zi'o rafsi effect on place structure of"   <cx "zi'o rafsi, effect of on place structure of lujvo">  XE "zi'o rafsi: effect of on place structure of lujvo"   Finally, lujvo involving “zi'o” are also possible, and are fully discussed in <a href=chap12.html>Chapter 12</a>. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for “zi'o” as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if anyone, drinks it) as a “se pinxe be zi'o”, the lujvo corresponding to this is “zilrelselpinxe” (deleting the second place of “se pinxe”). Deleting the x1 place in this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that “zilpavypinxe” has the same place structure as “zilrelselpinxe”, and “lo zilpavypinxe”, like “lo zilrelselpinxe”, refers to a beverage, and not to a non-existent drinker.
<p>
<cx "pro-bridi rafsi, as producing context-dependent meanings">  XE "pro-bridi rafsi: as producing context-dependent meanings"   <lx "co'e">  XE "co'e"   <lx "du">  XE "du"   <lx "bu'a">  XE "bu'a"   The pro-bridi “co'e”, “du”, and “bu'a” also have rafsi, which can be used just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for “du”-based lujvo) highly context-dependent meanings.

<h2>Chapter 8
<br>
Relative Clauses, Which Make sumti Even More Complicated</h2>
<h6>$Revision: 4.0 $<br>
mkhtml: 1.1</h6></p></center>
<p>
<a name=s1><h3>What are you pointing at?</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	poi	NOI	restrictive relative clause introducer
	ke'a	GOhA	relative pro-sumti
	ku'o	KUhO	relative clause terminator
</pre><lx "ti">  XE "ti"   <lx "ta">  XE "ta"   <lx "tu">  XE "tu"   Let us think about the problem of communicating what it is that we are pointing at when we are pointing at something. In Lojban, we can refer to what we are pointing at by using the pro-sumti “ti” if it is nearby, or “ta” if it is somewhat further away, or “tu” if it is distant. (Pro-sumti are explained in full in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7</a>.)
<p>
<cx "reference, ambiguity of ti/ta/tu">  XE "reference: ambiguity of ti/ta/tu"   However, even with the assistance of a pointing finger, or pointing lips, or whatever may be appropriate in the local culture, it is often hard for a listener to tell just what is being pointed at. Suppose one is pointing at a person (in particular, in the direction of his or her face), and says:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	ti cu barda
	This-one is-big.
</pre><p>What is the referent of “ti”? Is it the person? Or perhaps it is the person's nose? Or even (for “ti” can be plural as well as singular, and mean “these ones” as well as “this one”) the pores on the person's nose?
<p>
<cx "relative clause, use for reference">  XE "relative clause: use for reference"   <cx "reference, use of relative clause for">  XE "reference: use of relative clause for"   <lx "NOI">  XE "NOI selma’o"   <lx "ku'o">  XE "ku'o"   <lx "KUhO">  XE "KUhO selma’o"   <lx "poi">  XE "poi"   To help solve this problem, Lojban uses a construction called a “relative clause”. Relative clauses are usually attached to the end of sumti, but there are other places where they can go as well, as explained later in this chapter. A relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI, and ends with the elidable terminator “ku'o” (of selma'o KUhO). As you might suppose, “noi” is a cmavo of selma'o NOI; however, first we will discuss the cmavo “poi”, which also belongs to selma'o NOI.
<p>
<cx "poi, syntax of">  XE "poi: syntax of"   <lx "ke'a">  XE "ke'a"   <cx "relativized sumti, definition">  XE "relativized sumti: definition"   <cx "reference, to relativized sumti with ke'a">  XE "reference: to relativized sumti with ke'a"   <cx "ke'a, as referent for relativized sumti">  XE "ke'a: as referent for relativized sumti"   In between the “poi” and the “ku'o” appears a full bridi, with the same syntax as any other bridi. Anywhere within the bridi of a relative clause, the pro-sumti “ke'a” (of selma'o KOhA) may be used, and it stands for the sumti to which the relative clause is attached (called the “relativized sumti”). Here are some examples before we go any further:
<p>
<ex "big person">  XE "big person: example“  <pre><a name=e1d2>1.2)	ti poi ke'a prenu ku'o cu barda
	This-thing such-that-(IT is-a-person) is-large.
	This thing which is a person is big.
	This person is big.
</pre><ex "big nose">  XE "big nose: example“  <pre><a name=e1d3>1.3)	ti poi ke'a nazbi ku'o cu barda
	This-thing such-that-(IT is-a-nose) is-large.
	This thing which is a nose is big.
	This nose is big.

</pre><ex "big nose-pores">  XE "big nose-pores: example“  <pre><a name=e1d4>1.4)	ti poi ke'a nazbi kapkevna ku'o cu barda
	This-thing such-that-(IT is-a-nose-type-of skin-hole) is-big.
	These things which are nose-pores are big.
	These nose-pores are big.
</pre><cx "IT, as notation convention in relative clause chapter">  XE "IT: as notation convention in relative clause chapter"   In the literal translations throughout this chapter, the word “IT”, capitalized, is used to represent the cmavo “ke'a”. In each case, it serves to represent the sumti (in <a href=#e1d{2}>Examples 1.2 </a>through <a href=#e1d4>1.4</a>, the cmavo “ti”) to which the relative clause is attached.
<p>
<cx "ke'a, non-initial place use in relative clause">  XE "ke'a: non-initial place use in relative clause"   Of course, there is no reason why “ke'a” needs to appear in the x1 place of a relative clause bridi; it can appear in any place, or indeed even in a sub-bridi within the relative clause bridi. Here are two more examples:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d5>1.5)	tu poi le mlatu pu lacpu ke'a ku'o cu ratcu
	That-distant-thing such-that (the cat [past] drags IT) is-a-rat.
	That thing which the cat dragged is a rat.
	What the cat dragged is a rat.
<a name=e1d6>1.6)	ta poi mi djica le nu mi ponse ke'a [kei] ku'o cu bloti
	That-thing such-that (I desire the event-of (I own IT) ) is-a-boat.
	That thing that I want to own is a boat.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e1d6>Example 1.6</a>, “ke'a” appears in an abstraction clause (abstractions are explained in <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11</a>) within a relative clause.
<p>
<cx "ke'a, effect of omission of">  XE "ke'a: effect of omission of"   <cx "relative clause, effect of omission of “ke'a” on">  XE "relative clause: effect of omission of ke'a on"   Like any sumti, “ke'a” can be omitted. The usual presumption in that case is that it then falls into the x1 place:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d7>1.7)	ti poi nazbi cu barda
	This-thing which is-a-nose is-big.
</pre>almost certainly means the same thing as <a href=#e1d3>Example 1.3</a>. However, “ke'a” can be omitted if it is clear to the listener that it belongs in some place other than x1:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d8>1.8)	tu poi le mlatu pu lacpu cu ratcu
	That-distant-thing which the cat [past] drags is-a-rat
</pre>is equivalent to <a href=#e1d4>Example 1.4</a>.
<p>
<cx "ku'o, elidability for relative clauses">  XE "ku'o: elidability for relative clauses"   As stated before, “ku'o” is an elidable terminator, and in fact it is almost always elidable. Throughout the rest of this chapter, “ku'o” will not be written in any of the examples unless it is absolutely required: thus, <a href=#e1d2>Example 1.2 </a>can be written:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d9>1.9)	ti poi prenu cu barda
	That which is-a-person is-big.
	That person is big.
</pre><cx "poi, discussion of translation">  XE "poi: discussion of translation"   without any change in meaning. Note that “poi” is translated “which” rather than “such-that” when “ke'a” has been omitted from the x1 place of the relative clause bridi. The word “which” is used in English to introduce English relative clauses: other words that can be used are “who” and “that”, as in:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d10>1.10)	I saw a man who was going to the store.
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d11>1.11)	The building that the school was located in is large.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e1d10>Example 1.10 </a>the relative clause is “who was going to the store”, and in <a href=#e1d11>Example 1.11 </a>it is “that the school was located in”. Sometimes “who”, “which”, and “that” are used in literal translations in this chapter in order to make them read more smoothly.
<p>
<a name=s2><h3>Incidental relative clauses</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	noi	NOI	incidental relative clause introducer
</pre><cx "relative clauses, kinds of">  XE “relative clause: kinds of"   <cx "relative clause, restrictive (see also restrictive relative clause)">  XE "relative clause: restrictive (see also restrictive relative clause)"   <cx "restrictive relative clause, definition">  XE "restrictive relative clause: definition"   <cx "incidental relative clause, definition">  XE "incidental relative clause: definition"   <cx "non-restrictive relative clause, definition (see also incidental relative clause)">  XE "non-restrictive relative clause: definition (see also incidental relative clause)"   <cx "relative clauses, restricted contrasted with incidental">  XE “relative clause: restricted contrasted with incidental"   <lx "noi">  XE "noi"   There are two basic kinds of relative clauses: restrictive relative clauses introduced by “poi”, and incidental (sometimes called simply “non-restrictive”) relative clauses introduced by “noi”. The difference between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is that restrictive clauses provide information that is essential to identifying the referent of the sumti to which they are attached, whereas incidental relative clauses provide additional information which is helpful to the listener but is not essential for identifying the referent of the sumti. All of the examples in <a href=#s1>Section 1 </a>are restrictive relative clauses: the information in the relative clause is essential to identification. (The title of this chapter, though, uses an incidental relative clause.)
<p>
Consider the following examples:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	le gerku poi blanu cu barda
	The dog which is-blue is-large.
	The dog which is blue is large.
<a name=e2d2>2.2)	le gerku noi blanu cu barda
	The dog incidentally-which is-blue is-large.
	The dog, which is blue, is large.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e2d1>Example 2.1</a>, the information conveyed by “poi blanu” is essential to identifying the dog in question: it restricts the possible referents from dogs in general to dogs that are blue. This is why “poi” relative clauses are called restrictive. In <a href=#e2d2>Example 2.2</a>, on the other hand, the dog which is referred to has presumably already been identified clearly, and the relative clause “noi blanu” just provides additional information about it. (If in fact the dog hasn't been identified clearly, then the relative clause does not help identify it further.)
<p>
<cx "relative clauses, restricted contrasted with incidental in English expression">  XE “relative clause: restricted contrasted with incidental in English expression"   <cx "relative clauses, effect of commas in English">  XE “relative clause: effect of commas in English"   <cx "comma, effect on relative clause in English">  XE "comma: effect on relative clause in English"   <cx "incidental relative clause, as a parenthetical device">  XE "incidental relative clause: as a parenthetical device"   In English, the distinction between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is expressed in writing by surrounding incidental, but not restrictive, clauses with commas. These commas are functioning as parentheses, because incidental relative clauses are essentially parenthetical. This distinction in punctuation is represented in speech by a difference in tone of voice. In addition, English restrictive relative clauses can be introduced by “that” as well as “which” and “who”, whereas incidental relative clauses cannot begin with “that”. Lojban, however, always uses the cmavo “poi” and “noi” rather than punctuation or intonation to make the distinction.
<p>
Here are more examples of incidental relative clauses:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d3>2.3)	mi noi jdice cu zvati
	I who-incidentally am-a-judge am-at [some-place].
	I, a judge, am present.
</pre><p>In this example, “mi” is already sufficiently restricted, and the additional information that I am a judge is being provided solely for the listener's edification.

<p>
<pre><a name=e2d4>2.4)	xu do viska le mi karce noi blabi
	[True?] You see my car incidentally-which is-white.
	Do you see my car, which is white?
</pre><p>In <a href=#e2d4>Example 2.4</a>, the speaker is presumed to have only one car, and is providing incidental information that it is white. (Alternatively, he or she might have more than one car, since “le karce” can be plural, in which case the incidental information is that each of them is white.) Contrast <a href=#e2d5>Example 2.5 </a>with a restrictive relative clause:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d5>2.5)	xu do viska le mi karce poi blabi
	[True?] You see my car which is-white.
	Do you see my car that is white?
	Do you see my white car?
</pre><cx "relative clause, compared with tanru">  XE "relative clause: compared with tanru"   Here the speaker probably has several cars, and is restricting the referent of the sumti “le mi karce” (and thereby the listener's attention) to the white one only. <a href=#e2d5>Example 2.5 </a>means much the same as <a href=#e2d6>Example 2.6</a>, which does not use a relative clause:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d6>2.6)	xu do viska le mi blabi karce
	[True?] You see my white car.
	Do you see my car, the white one?
</pre><cx "relative clause, contrasted with tanru">  XE "relative clause: contrasted with tanru"   So a restrictive relative clause attached to a description can often mean the same as a description involving a tanru. However, “blabi karce”, like all tanru, is somewhat vague: in principle, it might refer to a car which carries white things, or even express some more complicated concept involving whiteness and car-ness; the restrictive relative clause of <a href=#e2d5>Example 2.5 </a>can only refer to a car which is white, not to any more complex or extended concept.
<p>
<a name=s3><h3>Relative phrases</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	pe	GOI	restrictive association
	po	GOI	restrictive possession
	po'e	GOI	restrictive intrinsic possession
	po'u	GOI	restrictive identification
	ne	GOI	incidental association
	no'u	GOI	incidental identification
	ge'u	GEhU	relative phrase terminator
</pre><cx "relative phrase, rationale for">  XE "relative phrase: rationale for"   <lx "GOI">  XE "GOI selma’o"   <cx "relative phrase, syntax of">  XE "relative phrase: syntax of"   <cx "relative phrase, as an abbreviation of a common relative clause">  XE "relative phrase: as an abbreviation of a common relative clause"   There are types of relative clauses (those which have a certain selbri) which are frequently wanted in Lojban, and can be expressed using a shortcut called a relative phrase. Relative phrases are introduced by cmavo of selma'o GOI, and consist of a GOI cmavo followed by a single sumti.
<p>
<lx "pe">  XE "pe"   <cx "pe, compared with “poi ke'a srana”">  XE "pe: compared with poi ke'a srana"   <cx "pe, as loose association">  XE "pe: as loose association"   <cx "loose association, expressing with pe">  XE "loose association: expressing with pe"   Here is an example of “pe”, plus an equivalent sentence using a relative clause:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d1>3.1)	le stizu pe mi cu blanu
	The chair associated-with me is-blue.
	My chair is blue.

<a name=e3d2>3.2)	le stizu poi ke'a srana mi cu blanu
	The chair such-that (IT is-associated-with me) is-blue.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e3d1>Example 3.1 </a>and <a href=#e3d2>Example 3.2</a>, the link between the chair and the speaker is of the loosest kind.
<p>
<lx "po">  XE "po"   <cx "po, compared with “poi ke'a se steci srana”">  XE "po: compared with poi ke'a se steci srana"   <cx "po, as restrictive possession">  XE "po: as restrictive possession"   <cx "possession, expressing with po">  XE "possession: expressing with po"   <cx "specificity, expressing with po">  XE "specificity: expressing with po"   Here is an example of “po”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d3>3.3)	le stizu po mi cu xunre
	The chair specific-to me is red.
<a name=e3d4>3.4)	le stizu poi ke'a se steci srana mi cu xunre
	The chair such-that (IT is-specifically associated-with me) is-red.
</pre><cx "pe, contrasted with po">  XE "pe: contrasted with po"   <cx "po, contrasted with pe">  XE "po: contrasted with pe"   <a href=#e3d3>Example 3.3 </a>and <a href=#e3d4>Example 3.4 </a>contrast with <a href=#e3d1>Example 3.1 </a>and <a href=#e3d2>Example 3.2</a>: the chair is more permanently connected with the speaker. A plausible (though not the only possible) contrast between <a href=#e3d1>Example 3.1 </a>and <a href=#e3d3>Example 3.3 </a>is that “pe mi” would be appropriate for a chair the speaker is currently sitting on (whether or not the speaker owned that chair), and “po mi” for a chair owned by the speaker (whether or not he or she was currently occupying it).
<p>
<cx "po, contrasted with English “possession”">  XE "po: contrasted with English possession"   As a result, the relationship expressed between two sumti by “po” is usually called “possession”, although it does not necessarily imply ownership, legal or otherwise. The central concept is that of specificity (“steci” in Lojban).
<p>
<lx "po'e">  XE "po'e"   <cx "po'e, compared with “poi ke'a jinzi ke se steci srana”">  XE "po'e: compared with poi ke'a jinzi ke se steci srana"   <cx "po'e, as intrinsic possession">  XE "po'e: as intrinsic possession"   <cx "possession, intrinsic, expressing with po'e">  XE "possession: intrinsic, expressing with po'e"   <cx "intrinsic possession, expressing with po'e">  XE "intrinsic possession: expressing with po'e"   <cx "inalienable possession, expressing with po'e">  XE "inalienable possession: expressing with po'e"   Here is an example of “po'e”, as well as another example of “po”:
<p>
<ex "person's arm">  XE "person's arm: example“  <pre><a name=e3d5>3.5)	le birka po'e mi cu spofu
	The arm intrinsically-possessed-by me is-broken
<a name=e3d6>3.6)	le birka poi jinzi ke se steci srana mi cu spofu
	The arm which is-intrinsically (specifically associated-with) me is-broken.
<a name=e3d7>3.7)	le botpi po mi cu spofu
	The bottle specific-to me is-broken
</pre><cx "po'e, contrasted with po">  XE "po'e: contrasted with po"   <cx "po, contrasted with po'e">  XE "po: contrasted with po'e"   <cx "intrinsic possession, definition">  XE "intrinsic possession: definition"   <cx "inalienable possession, definition">  XE "inalienable possession: definition"   <cx "extrinsic possession, definition">  XE "extrinsic possession: definition"   <cx "alienable possession, definition">  XE "alienable possession: definition"   <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5 </a>and <a href=#e3d6>Example 3.6 </a>on the one hand, and <a href=#e3d7>Example 3.7 </a>on the other, illustrate the contrast between two types of possession called “intrinsic” and “extrinsic”, or sometimes “inalienable” and “alienable”, respectively. Something is intrinsically (or inalienably) possessed by someone if the possession is part of the possessor, and cannot be changed without changing the possessor. In the case of <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5</a>, people are usually taken to intrinsically possess their arms: even if an arm is cut off, it remains the arm of that person. (If the arm is transplanted to another person, however, it becomes intrinsically possessed by the new user, though, so intrinsic possession is a matter of degree.)
<p>
<cx "inalienable, distinguishing from alienable">  XE "inalienable: distinguishing from alienable"   By contrast, the bottle of <a href=#e3d7>Example 3.7 </a>can be given away, or thrown away, or lost, or stolen, so it is possessed extrinsically (alienably). The exact line between intrinsic and extrinsic possession is culturally dependent. The U.S. Declaration of Independence speaks of the “inalienable rights” of men, but just what those rights are, and even whether the concept makes sense at all, varies from culture to culture.
<p>
Note that <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5 </a>can also be expressed without a relative clause:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d8>3.8)	le birka be mi cu spofu
	The arm of-body me is broken
</pre><cx "intrinsic possession, expressing by using place in some selbri">  XE "intrinsic possession: expressing by using place in some selbri"   reflecting the fact that the gismu “birka” has an x2 place representing the body to which the arm belongs. Many, but not all, cases of intrinsic possession can be thus covered without using “po'e” by placing the possessor into the appropriate place of the description selbri.
<p>
<lx "po'u">  XE "po'u"   Here is an example of “po'u”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d9>3.9)	le gerku po'u le mi pendo cu cinba mi
	The dog which-is my friend kisses me.
<a name=e3d10>3.10)	le gerku poi du le mi pendo cu cinba mi
	The dog which = my friend kisses me.
</pre><cx "po'u, compared with “poi ke'a du”">  XE "po'u: compared with poi ke'a du"   <cx "po'u, as identity">  XE "po'u: as identity"   <cx "identity, expressing with po'u">  XE "identity: expressing with po'u"   The cmavo “po'u” does not represent possession at all, but rather identity. (Note that it means “poi du” and its form was chosen to suggest the relationship.)
<p>
In <a href=#e3d9>Example 3.9 </a>, the use of “po'u” tells us that “le gerku” and “le mi pendo” represent the same thing. Consider the contrast between <a href=#e3d9>Example 3.9 </a>and:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d11>3.11)	le mi pendo po'u le gerku cu cinba mi
	My friend which-is the dog kisses me.
</pre><cx "po'u, relative phrase of contrasted with relativized sumti of">  XE "po'u: relative phrase of contrasted with relativized sumti of"   The facts of the case are the same, but the listener's knowledge about the situation may not be. In <a href=#e3d9>Example 3.9</a>, the listener is presumed not to understand which dog is meant by “le gerku”, so the speaker adds a relative phrase clarifying that it is the particular dog which is the speaker's friend.
<p>
<a href=#e3d11>Example 3.11</a>, however, assumes that the listener does not know which of the speaker's friends is referred to, and specifies that it is the friend that is the dog (which dog is taken to be obvious). Here is another example of the same contrast:
<p>
<ex "New York city">  XE "New York city: example“  <ex "New York state">  XE "New York state: example“  <pre><a name=e3d12>3.12)	le tcadu po'u la nu,iork
	The city of New York [not another city].
<a name=e3d13>3.13)	la nu,iork po'u le tcadu
	New York the city (not the state or some other New York)
</pre><cx "possessor in relative phrases, compared with possessed">  XE "possessor in relative phrases: compared with possessed"   <cx "possessed in relative phrases, compared with possessor">  XE "possessed in relative phrases: compared with possessor"   The principle that the possessor and the possessed may change places applies to all the GOI cmavo, and allows for the possibility of odd effects:
<p>
<ex "friend's cup">  XE "friend's cup: example“  <pre><a name=e3d14>3.14)	le kabri pe le mi pendo cu cmalu
	The cup associated-with my friend is small.
	My friend's cup is small
</pre><ex "cup's friend">  XE "cup's friend: example“  <pre><a name=e3d15>3.15)	le mi pendo pe le kabri cu cmalu
	My friend associated-with the cup is small.
	My friend, the one with the cup, is small.
</pre><a href=#e3d14>Example 3.14 </a>is useful in a context which is about my friend, and states that his or her cup is small, whereas <a href=#e3d15>Example 3.15 </a>is useful in a context that is primarily about a certain cup, and makes a claim about “my friend of the cup”, as opposed to some other friend of mine. Here the cup appears to “possess” the person! English can't even express this relationship with a possessive — “the cup's friend of mine” looks like nonsense — but Lojban has no trouble doing so.
<p>
<lx "ne">  XE "ne"   <lx "no'u">  XE "no'u"   <cx "ne, compared with pe">  XE "ne: compared with pe"   <cx "no'u, compared with po'u">  XE "no'u: compared with po'u"   <cx "pe, compared with ne">  XE "pe: compared with ne"   <cx "po'u, compared with no'u">  XE "po'u: compared with no'u"   <cx "incidental association, expressing with ne">  XE "incidental association: expressing with ne"   <cx "incidental identification, expressing with no'u">  XE "incidental identification: expressing with no'u"   Finally, the cmavo “ne” and “no'u” stand to “pe” and “po'u”, respectively, as “noi” does to “poi” — they provide incidental information:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d16>3.16)	le blabi gerku ne mi cu batci do
	The white dog, incidentally-associated-with me, bites you.
	The white dog, which is mine, bites you.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e3d16>Example 3.16</a>, the white dog is already fully identified (after all, presumably the listener know which dog bit him or her!). The fact that it is yours is merely incidental to the main bridi claim.
<p>
<cx "no'u, contrasted with po'u">  XE "no'u: contrasted with po'u"   <cx "po'u, contrasted with no'u">  XE "po'u: contrasted with no'u"   Distinguishing between “po'u” and “no'u” can be a little tricky. Consider a room with several men in it, one of whom is named Jim. If you don't know their names, I might say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d17>3.17)	le nanmu no'u la djim. cu terpemci
	The man, incidentally-who-is Jim, is-a-poet.
	The man, Jim, is a poet.
</pre><p>Here I am saying that one of the men is a poet, and incidentally telling you that he is Jim. But if you do know the names, then
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d18>3.18)	le nanmu po'u la djim. cu terpemci

The idiomatic English sentence
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d19>3.19)	The man put his hands in his pockets.
</pre>seems strange to a French- or German-speaking person: whose pockets would he put his hands into? and even odder, whose hands would he put into his pockets? In Lojban, the sentence

However, if a logical connective immediately follows a sumti modified by a relative phrase, then an explicit “ge'u” is needed to allow the connective to affect the relativized sumti rather than the sumti of the relative phrase. (What about the cmavo after which selma'o GOI is named? It is discussed in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7</a>, as it is not semantically akin to the other kinds of relative phrases, although the syntax is the same.)

a name=s4><h3>Multiple relative clauses: “zi'e”</h3>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	zi'e	ZIhE	relative clause joiner
</pre><cx "multiple relative clauses, attaching with zi'e">  XE "multiple relative clauses: attaching with zi'e"   <lx "zi'e">  XE "zi'e"   <lx "ZIhE">  XE "ZIhE selma’o"   Sometimes it is necessary or useful to attach more than one relative clause to a sumti. This is made possible in Lojban by the cmavo “zi'e” (of selma'o ZIhE), which is used to join one or more relative clauses together into a single unit, thus making them apply to the same sumti. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d1>4.1)	le gerku poi blabi zi'e poi batci le nanmu cu klama
	The dog which is white and which bites the man goes.
</pre><cx "zi'e, contrasted with logical connectives">  XE "zi'e: contrasted with logical connectives"   <cx "zi'e, compared with “and”">  XE "zi'e: compared with English and"   The most usual translation of “zi'e” in English is “and”, but “zi'e” is not really a logical connective: unlike most of the true logical connectives (which are explained in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>), it cannot be converted into a logical connection between sentences.
<p>
<cx "multiple relative clauses, connecting different kinds with zi'e">  XE "multiple relative clauses: connecting different kinds with zi'e"   <cx "relative clause, connecting to relative phrase with zi'e">  XE "relative clause: connecting to relative phrase with zi'e"   <cx "relative phrase, connecting to relative clause with zi'e">  XE "relative phrase: connecting to relative clause with zi'e"   It is perfectly correct to use “zi'e” to connect relative clauses of different kinds:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d2>4.2)	le gerku poi blabi zi'e noi le mi pendo cu ponse ke'a cu klama
	The dog that-is (white) and incidentally-such-that (my friend owns IT) goes.
	The dog that is white, which my friend owns, is going.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e4d2>Example 4.2</a>, the restrictive clause “poi blabi” specifies which dog is referred to, but the incidental clause “noi le mi pendo cu ponse” is mere incidental information: the listener is supposed to already have identified the dog from the “poi blabi”. Of course, the meaning (though not necessarily the emphasis) is the same if the incidental clause appears first.
<p>
<cx "zi'e, use in connecting relative phrase/clause to relative phrase/clause">  XE "zi'e: use in connecting relative phrase/clause to relative phrase/clause"   It is also possible to connect relative phrases with “zi'e”, or a relative phrase with a relative clause:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d3>4.3)	le botpi po mi zi'e poi blanu cu spofu
	The bottle specific-to me and which-is blue is-broken.
	My blue bottle is broken.
</pre><p>Note that if the colloquial translation of <a href=#e4d3>Example 4.3 </a>were “My bottle, which is blue, is broken”, then “noi” rather than “poi” would have been correct in the Lojban version, since that version of the English implies that you do not need to know the bottle is blue. As written, <a href=#e4d3>Example 4.3 </a>suggests that I probably have more than one bottle, and the one in question needs to be picked out as the blue one.
<p>
<ex "my chair">  XE "my chair: example“  <pre><a name=e4d4>4.4)	mi ba zutse le stizu pe mi zi'e po do

	I [future] sit-in the chair associated-with me and specific-to you
		and which-is red.
	I will sit in my chair (really yours), the red one.
</pre><a href=#e4d4>Example 4.4 </a>illustrates that more than two relative phrases or clauses can be connected with “zi'e”. It almost defies colloquial translation because of the very un-English contrast between “pe mi”, implying that the chair is temporarily connected with me, and “po do”, implying that the chair has a more permanent association with you. (Perhaps I am a guest in your house, in which case the chair would naturally be your property.)
<p>
Here is another example, mixing a relative phrase and two relative clauses, a restrictive one and a non-restrictive one:
<p>
<ex "beans">  XE "beans: example“  <pre><a name=e4d5>4.5)	mi ba citka le dembi pe mi

	I'll eat my beans that are on my plate, the ones you gave me.

</pre><a name=s5><h3>Non-veridical relative clauses: “voi”</h3>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	voi	NOI	non-veridical relative clause introducer
</pre><lx "voi">  XE "voi"   <cx "voi, contrasted with poi in veridicality">  XE "voi: contrasted with poi in veridicality"   <cx "poi, contrasted with voi in veridicality">  XE "poi: contrasted with voi in veridicality"   <cx "restrictive relative clauses, non-veridical using voi">  XE "restrictive relative clauses: non-veridical using voi"   <cx "restrictive relative clauses, veridical using poi">  XE "restrictive relative clauses: veridical using poi"   There is another member of selma'o NOI which serves to introduce a third kind of relative clause: “voi”. Relative clauses introduced by “voi” are restrictive, like those introduced by “poi”. However, there is a fundamental difference between “poi” and “voi” relative clauses. A “poi” relative clause is said to be veridical, in the same sense that a description using “lo” or “loi” is: it is essential to the interpretation that the bridi actually be true. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	le gerku poi blabi cu klama
	The dog which is-white goes.
</pre>it must actually be true that the dog is white, or the sentence constitutes a miscommunication. If there is a white dog and a brown dog, and the speaker uses “le gerku poi blabi” to refer to the brown dog, then the listener will not understand correctly. However,
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d2>5.2)	le gerku voi blabi cu klama
	The dog which-I-describe-as white goes
</pre>puts the listener on notice that the dog in question may not actually meet objective standards (whatever they are) for being white: only the speaker can say exactly what is meant by the term. In this way, “voi” is like “le”; the speaker's intention determines the meaning.
<p>
As a result, the following two sentences
<p>
<ex "man is woman">  XE "man is woman: example“  <pre><a name=e5d3>5.3)	le nanmu cu ninmu
	That-which-I-describe-as a-man is-a-woman.
	The “guy” is actually a gal.
<a name=e5d4>5.4)	ti voi nanmu cu ninmu
	This-thing which-I-describe-as a-man is-a-woman.
</pre>mean essentially the same thing (except that <a href=#e5d5>Example 5.5 </a>involves pointing thanks to the use of “ti”, whereas <a href=#e5d4>Example 5.4 </a>doesn't), and neither one is self-contradictory: it is perfectly all right to describe something as a man (although perhaps confusing to the listener) even if it actually is a woman.
<p>
<a name=s6><h3>Relative clauses and descriptors</h3>
<p>
<cx "relative clause after sumti, as common placement in sentence">  XE "relative clause after sumti: as common placement in sentence"   So far, this chapter has described the various kinds of relative clauses (including relative phrases). The list is now complete, and the rest of the chapter will be concerned with the syntax of sumti that include relative clauses. So far, all relative clauses have appeared directly after the sumti to which they are attached. This is the most common position (and originally the only one), but a variety of other placements are also possible which produce a variety of semantic effects.
<p>
<cx "relative clauses, placement in sentence">  XE “relative clause: placement in sentence"   <cx "relative clauses, effect of elided “ku” of relativized sumti">  XE “relative clause: effect of elided ku of relativized sumti"   <lx "ku">  XE "ku"   <lx "le">  XE "le"   There are actually three places where a relative clause can be attached to a description sumti: after the descriptor (“le”, “lo”, or whatever), after the embedded selbri but before the elidable terminator (which is “ku”), and after the “ku”. The relative clauses attached to descriptors that we have seen have occupied the second position. Thus <a href=#e5d1>Example 5.1</a>, if written out with all elidable terminators, would appear as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d1>6.1)	le gerku poi blabi ku'o ku cu klama vau
	The (dog which (is-white) ) goes.
	The dog which is white is going.
</pre><lx "ku'o">  XE "ku'o"   <lx "vau">  XE "vau"   Here “ku'o” is the terminator paired with “poi” and “ku” with “le”, and “vau” is the terminator of the whole bridi.
<p>
<cx "relative clause placement, on sumti with simple descriptor">  XE "relative clause placement: on sumti with simple descriptor"   When a simple descriptor using “le”, like “le gerku”, has a relative clause attached, it is purely a matter of style and emphasis where the relative clause should go. Therefore, the following examples are all equivalent in meaning to <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1</a>:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d2>6.2)	le poi blabi ku'o gerku cu klama
	The such-that (it-is-white) dog goes.
<a name=e6d3>6.3)	le gerku ku poi blabi cu klama
	The (dog) which is-white goes.
</pre><cx "relative clause placement, English contrasted with Chinese and Finnish">  XE "relative clause placement: English contrasted with Chinese and Finnish"   <cx "relative clause after descriptor, effect on elidability of ku'o">  XE "relative clause after descriptor: effect on elidability of ku'o"   <cx "ku'o, effect of relative clause after descriptor on elidability">  XE "ku'o: effect of relative clause after descriptor on elidability"   <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1 </a>will seem most natural to speakers of languages like English, which always puts relative clauses after the noun phrases they are attached to; <a href=#e6d2>Example 6.2</a>, on the other hand, may seem more natural to Finnish or Chinese speakers, who put the relative clause first. Note that in <a href=#e6d2>Example 6.2</a>, the elidable terminator “ku'o” must appear, or the selbri of the relative clause (“blabi”) will merge with the selbri of the description (“gerku”), resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. The purpose of the form appearing in <a href=#e6d3>Example 6.3 </a>will be apparent shortly.
<p>
<cx "inner quantifier of sumti, meaning of">  XE "inner quantifier of sumti: meaning of"   <cx "outer quantifier of sumti, meaning of">  XE "outer quantifier of sumti: meaning of"   As is explained in detail in <a href=chap6.html>Chapter 6</a>, two different numbers (known as the “inner quantifier” and the “outer quantifier”) can be attached to a description. The inner quantifier specifies how many things the descriptor refers to: it appears between the descriptor and the description selbri. The outer quantifier appears before the descriptor, and specifies how many of the things referred to by the descriptor are involved in this particular bridi. In the following example,
<p>
<ex "five people">  XE "five people: example“  <pre><a name=e6d4>6.4)	re le mu prenu cu klama le zarci
	Two-of the five persons go to-the market.

Now what is meant by attaching a relative clause to the sumti “re le mu prenu”? Suppose the relative clause is “poi ninmu” (meaning “who are women”). Now the three possible attachment points discussed previously take on significance.
<p>
<cx "relative clause before inner quantifier, meaning">  XE "relative clause before inner quantifier: meaning"   <pre><a name=e6d5>6.5)	re le poi ninmu ku'o mu prenu cu klama le zarci

	Two women out of the five persons go to the market.
</pre><cx "relative clause scope, with quantified relativized sumti">  XE "relative clause scope: with quantified relativized sumti"   <cx "quantified sumti, relative clause scope with">  XE "quantified sumti: relative clause scope with"   <cx "relative clauses and quantified sumti, placement considerations">  XE “relative clause and quantified sumti: placement considerations"   As the parentheses show, <a href=#e6d6>Example 6.6 </a>means that all five of the persons are women, whereas <a href=#e6d7>Example 6.7 </a>means that the two who are going to the market are women. How do we remember which is which? If the relative clause comes after the explicit “ku”, as in <a href=#e6d7>Example 6.7</a>, then the sumti as a whole is qualified by the relative clause. If there is no “ku”, or if the relative clause comes before an explicit “ku”, then the relative clause is understood to apply to everything which the underlying selbri applies to.
<p>
What about <a href=#e6d5>Example 6.5</a>? By convention, it means the same as <a href=#e6d7>Example 6.7</a>, and it requires no “ku”, but it does typically require a “ku'o” instead. Note that the relative clause comes before the inner quantifier.

Thus “le gerku” is taken to mean “all of the things I refer to as dogs”, possibly all one of them. In that case, there is no difference between a relative clause after the “ku” or before it. However, if the descriptor is “lo”, the difference is quite important:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d8>6.8)	lo prenu ku noi blabi cu klama le zarci
	(Some persons) incidentally-which are-white go to-the market.
	Some people, who are white, go to the market.
<a name=e6d9>6.9)	lo prenu noi blabi [ku] cu klama le zarci
	Some (persons incidentally-which are-white) go to-the market.
	Some of the people, who by the way are white, go to the market.
</pre><p>Both <a href=#e6d{8}>Examples 6.8 </a>and <a href=#e6d9>6.9 </a>tell us that one or more persons are going to the market. However, they make very different incidental claims. Now, what does “lo prenu noi blabi” mean? Well, the default inner quantifier is “ro” (meaning “all”), and the default outer quantifier is “su'o” (meaning “at least one”). Therefore, we must first take all persons, then choose at least one of them. That one or more people will be going.
<p>
In <a href=#e6d8>Example 6.8</a>, the relative clause described the sumti once the outer quantifier was applied: one or more people, who are white, are going. But in <a href=#e6d9>Example 6.9</a>, the relative clause actually describes the sumti before the outer quantification is applied, so that it ends up meaning “First take all persons — by the way, they're all white”. But not all people are white, so the incidental claim being made here is false.
<p>
<cx "relative clauses on lo, syntax suggestion">  XE “relative clause on lo: syntax suggestion"   The safe strategy, therefore, is to always use “ku” when attaching a “noi” relative clause to a “lo” descriptor. Otherwise we may end up claiming far too much.

A relative clause inside the “ku”, whether before or after the selbri, is reckoned part of the name; a relative clause outside the “ku” is not. Therefore,
<p>
<ex "afraid of horse">  XE "afraid of horse: example“  <pre><a name=e6d10>6.10)	mi viska la nanmu poi terpa le ke'a xirma [ku]

<cx "relative clauses, impact of indefinite sumti on placement">  XE “relative clause: impact of indefinite sumti on placement"   <cx "relative clauses and indefinite sumti, placement considerations">  XE “relative clause and indefinite sumti: placement considerations"   Finally, so-called indefinite sumti like “re karce”, which means almost the same as “re lo karce” (which in turn means the same as “re lo ro karce”), can have relative clauses attached; these are taken to be of the outside-the-“ku” variety. Here is an example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d12>6.12)	mi ponse re karce [ku] poi xekri

It is ungrammatical to try to place a relative clause within an indefinite sumti (that is, before an explicitly expressed terminating “ku”.) Use an explicit “lo” instead.
<p>

Although it might not seem so, this sumti actually contains a relative phrase. When a sumti appears between a descriptor and its description selbri, it is actually a “pe” relative phrase. So
<p>
<ex "my">  XE "my: example“  <pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	le mi karce cu xunre
	My car is-red.
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d2>7.2)	le pe mi karce cu xunre
	The (associated-with me) car is-red.
</pre>mean exactly the same thing. Furthermore, since there are no special considerations of quantifiers here,
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d3>7.3)	le karce pe mi cu xunre
	The car associated-with me is-red.
</pre><cx "possessive sumti, definition">  XE "possessive sumti: definition"   <cx "possessor sumti, definition">  XE "possessive sumti: definition"   means the same thing as well. A sumti like the one in <a href=#e7d1>Example 7.1 </a>is called a “possessive sumti”. Of course, it does not really indicate possession in the sense of ownership, but like “pe” relative phrases, indicates only weak association; you can say “le mi karce” even if you've only borrowed it for the night. (In English, “my car” usually means “le karce po mi”, but we do not have the same sense of possession in “my seat on the bus”; Lojban simply makes the weaker sense the standard one.) The inner sumti, “mi” in <a href=#e7d1>Example 7.1</a>, is correspondingly called the “possessor sumti”.
<p>
<cx "possessive sumti and relative clauses, development history">  XE "possessive sumti and relative clauses: development history"   <cx "relative clauses and possessive sumti, development history">  XE “relative clause and possessive sumti: development history"   Historically, possessive sumti existed before any other kind of relative phrase or clause, and were retained when the machinery of relative phrases and clauses as detailed in this chapter so far was slowly built up. When preposed relative clauses of the <a href=#e7d2>Example 7.2 </a>type were devised, possessive sumti were most easily viewed as a special case of them.
<p>
<cx "possessor sumti, syntax allowed">  XE "possessive sumti: syntax allowed"   <cx "possessor sumti, contrasted with relative phrases in complexity allowed">  XE "possessive sumti: contrasted with relative phrases in complexity allowed"   <cx "relative phrases, contrasted with possessor sumti in complexity allowed">  XE “relative phrase: contrasted with possessive sumti in complexity allowed"   <cx "pro-sumti, as possessor sumti">  XE "pro-sumti: as possessive sumti"   <cx "names, as possessor sumti">  XE "names: as possessive sumti"   <cx "descriptions, as possessor sumti">  XE "descriptions: as possessive sumti"   <cx "quotations, as possessor sumti">  XE “quotation: as possessive sumti"   <cx "numbers, as possessor sumti">  XE "numbers: as possessive sumti"   Although any sumti, however complex, can appear in a full-fledged relative phrase, only simple sumti can appear as possessor sumti, without a “pe”. Roughly speaking, the legal possessor sumti are: pro-sumti, quotations, names and descriptions, and numbers. In addition, the possessor sumti may not be preceded by a quantifier, as such a form would be interpreted as the unusual “descriptor + quantifier + sumti” type of description. All these sumti forms are explained in full in <a href=chap6.html>Chapter 6</a>.

<p>
Here is an example of a description used in a possessive sumti:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d4>7.4)	le le nanmu ku karce cu blanu
	The (associated-with-the man) car is blue.
	The man's car is blue.

Because of the need for this “ku”, the most common kind of possessor sumti are pro-sumti, especially personal pro-sumti, which require no elidable terminator. Descriptions are more likely to be attached with relative phrases.
</pre><p>And here is a number used as a possessor sumti:
<p>
<ex "juror 5">  XE "juror 5: example“  <pre><a name=e7d5>7.5)	le li mu jdice se bende
	The of-the-number-five judging team-member
	Juror number 5

This would need no comment if it were not for the following special rule: a relative clause immediately following the possessor sumti is understood to affect the possessor sumti, not the possessive. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d6>7.6)	le mi noi sipna vau karce cu na klama
	The of-me incidentally-which-(is-sleeping) car isn't going.
</pre>means that my car isn't going; the incidental claim of “noi sipna” applies to me, not my car, however. If I wanted to say that the car is sleeping (whatever that might mean) I would need:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d7>7.7)	le mi karce poi sipna cu na klama
	The of-me car which sleeps isn't going.
</pre><cx "vau, effect on elidability ku'o">  XE "vau: effect on elidability ku'o"   <cx "ku'o, effect of vau on elidability">  XE "ku'o: effect of vau on elidability"   Note that <a href=#e7d6>Example 7.6 </a>uses “vau” rather than “ku'o” at the end of the relative clause: this terminator ends every simple bridi and is almost always elidable; in this case, though, it is a syllable shorter than the equally valid alternative, “ku'o”.
<p>
<a name=s8><h3>Relative clauses and complex sumti: “vu'o”</h3>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	vu'o	VUhO	relative clause attacher
</pre><p>Normally, relative clauses attach only to simple sumti or parts of sumti: pro-sumti, names and descriptions, pure numbers, and quotations. An example of a relative clause attached to a pure number is:
<p>
<cx "relative clause, on number">  XE "relative clause: on number"   <ex "irrational number">  XE "irrational number: example“  <pre><a name=e8d1>8.1)	li pai noi na'e frinu namcu
	The-number pi, incidentally-which is-a-non- fraction number
	The irrational number pi

</pre><cx "relative clause, on quotation">  XE "relative clause: on quotation"   And here is an incidental relative clause attached to a quotation:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d2>8.2)	lu mi klama le zarci li'u
		noi mi cusku ke'a cu jufra
	[quote] I go to-the market [unquote]
		incidentally-which-(I express IT) is-a-sentence.
	“I'm going to the market”, which I'd said, is a sentence.
</pre>which may serve to identify the author of the quotation or some other relevant, but subsidiary, fact about it. All such relative clauses appear only after the simple sumti, never before it.
<p>
<lx "LAhE">  XE "LAhE selma’o"   <lx "NAhE">  XE "NAhE selma’o"   <cx "relative clauses, impact of LAhE on placement">  XE “relative clause: impact of LAhE on placement"   <cx "relative clauses and LAhE, placement considerations">  XE “relative clause and LAhE: placement considerations"   <cx "relative clauses, impact of NAhE on placement">  XE “relative clause: impact of NAhE on placement"   <cx "relative clauses and NAhE, placement considerations">  XE “relative clause and NAhE: placement considerations"   <cx "LAhE, effect of relative clause placement with">  XE "LAhE selma’o: effect of relative clause placement with"   <cx "NAhE, effect of relative clause placement with">  XE "NAhE selma’o: effect of relative clause placement with"   In addition, sumti with attached sumti qualifiers of selma'o LAhE or NAhE+BO (which are explained in detail in <a href=chap6.html>Chapter 6</a>) can have a relative clause appearing after the qualifier and before the qualified sumti, as in:
<p>
<ex "red pony">  XE "red pony: example“  <lx "la'e">  XE "la'e"   <pre><a name=e8d3>8.3)	la'e poi tolcitno vau lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u
		cu zvati le vu kumfa
	A-referent-of (which is-old) [quote] The Red Small-horse [unquote]
		is-at the [far distance] room.
	An old “The Red Pony” is in the far room.
</pre><a href=#e8d3>Example 8.3 </a>is a bit complex, and may need some picking apart. The quotation “lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u” means the string of words “The Red Pony”. If the “la'e” at the beginning of the sentence were omitted, <a href=#e8d3>Example 8.3 </a>would claim that a certain string of words is in a room distant from the speaker. But obviously a string of words can't be in a room! The effect of the “la'e” is to modify the sumti so that it refers not to the words themselves, but to the referent of those words, a novel by John Steinbeck (presumably in Lojban translation). The particular copy of “The Red Pony” is identified by the restrictive relative clause. <a href=#e8d3>Example 8.3 </a>means exactly the same as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d4>8.4)	la'e lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u lu'u
		poi to'ercitno cu zvati le vu kumfa
	A-referent-of ([quote] The Red Small-horse [unquote])
		which is-old is-at the [far distance] room.
</pre>and the two sentences can be considered stylistic variants. Note the required “lu'u” terminator, which prevents the relative clause from attaching to the quotation itself: we do not wish to refer to an old quotation!
<p>
<cx "relative clauses, on connected sumti">  XE “relative clause: on connected sumti"   Sometimes, however, it is important to make a relative clause apply to the whole of a more complex sumti, one which involves logical or non-logical connection (explained in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>). For example,
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d5>8.5)	la frank. .e la djordj. noi nanmu cu klama le zdani
	Frank and George incidentally-who is-a-man go to-the house.
	Frank and George, who is a man, go to the house.
</pre><p>The incidental claim in <a href=#e8d5>Example 8.5 </a>is not that Frank and George are men, but only that George is a man, because the incidental relative clause attaches only to “la djordj”, the immediately preceding simple sumti.
<p>
<lx "vu'o">  XE "vu'o"   <lx "VUhO">  XE "VUhO selma’o"   <cx "relative clause scope, extending to preceding sumti with vu'o">  XE "relative clause scope: extending to preceding sumti with vu'o"   To make a relative clause attach to both parts of the logically connected sumti in <a href=#e8d5>Example 8.5</a>, a new cmavo is needed, “vu'o” (of selma'o VUhO). It is placed between the sumti and the relative clause, and extends the sphere of influence of that relative clause to the entire preceding sumti, including however many logical or non-logical connectives there may be.
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d6>8.6)	la frank. .e la djordj. vu'o noi nanmu cu klama le zdani
	Frank and George incidentally-who are-men go to-the house.
	Frank and George, who are men, go to the house.
</pre><p>The presence of “vu'o” here means that the relative clause “noi nanmu” extends to the entire logically connected sumti “la frank. .e la djordj.”; in other words, both Frank and George are claimed to be men, as the colloquial translation shows.
<p>
<cx "relative clauses on complex sumti, Lojban contrasted with English">  XE “relative clause on complex sumti: Lojban contrasted with English"   English is able to resolve the distinction correctly in the case of <a href=#e8d5>Example 8.5 </a>and <a href=#e8d6>Example 8.6 </a>by making use of number: “who is” rather than “who are”. Lojban doesn't distinguish between singular and plural verbs: “nanmu” can mean “is a man” or “are men”, so another means is required. Furthermore, Lojban's mechanism works correctly in general: if “nanmu” (meaning “is-a-man”) were replaced with “pu bajra” (“ran”), English would have to make the distinction some other way:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d7>8.7)	la frank. .e la djordj. noi pu bajra cu klama le zdani
	Frank and (George who [past] runs) go to-the house.
	Frank and George, who ran, go to the house.
<a name=e8d8>8.8)	la frank. .e la djordj. vu'o noi pu bajra cu klama le zdani
	(Frank and George) who [past] runs go to-the house.
	Frank and George, who ran, go to the house.
</pre><p>In spoken English, tone of voice would serve; in written English, one or both sentences would need rewriting.
<p>
<a name=s9><h3>Relative clauses in vocative phrases</h3>
<p>
<lx "COI">  XE "COI selma’o"   <lx "DOI">  XE "DOI selma’o"   Vocative phrases are explained in more detail in <a href=chap6.html>Chapter 6</a>. Briefly, they are a method of indicating who a sentence or discourse is addressed to: of identifying the intended listener. They take three general forms, all beginning with cmavo from selma'o COI or DOI (called “vocative words”; there can be one or many), followed by either a name, a selbri, or a sumti. Here are three examples:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	coi. frank.
	Hello, Frank.
<a name=e9d2>9.2)	co'o xirma
	Goodbye, horse.
<a name=e9d3>9.3)	fi'i la frank. .e la djordj.
	Welcome, Frank and George!
</pre><p>Note that <a href=#e9d2>Example 9.2 </a>says farewell to something which doesn't really have to be a horse, something that the speaker simply thinks of as being a horse, or even might be something (a person, for example) who is named “Horse”. In a sense, <a href=#e9d2>Example 9.2 </a>is ambiguous between “co'o le xirma” and “co'o la xirma”, a relatively safe semantic ambiguity, since names are ambiguous in general: saying “George” doesn't distinguish between the possible Georges.

<p>
Similarly, <a href=#e9d1>Example 9.1 </a>can be thought of as an abbreviation of:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d4>9.4)	coi la frank.
	Hello, the-one-named “Frank”.
</pre><p>Syntactically, vocative phrases are a kind of free modifier, and can appear in many places in Lojban text, generally at the beginning or end of some complete construct; or, as in <a href=#e9d{1}>Examples 9.1 </a>to <a href=#e9d3>9.3</a>, as sentences by themselves.
<p>
<cx "relative clauses, on vocative phrases">  XE “relative clause: on vocative phrases"   <cx "vocative phrases, relative clauses on">  XE "vocative phrase: relative clauses on"   <cx "relative clauses, placement with vocative phrases">  XE “relative clause: placement with vocative phrases"   <cx "vocative phrase with name, placement of relative clause on">  XE "vocative phrase with name: placement of relative clause on"   As can be seen, the form of vocative phrases is similar to that of sumti, and as you might expect, vocative phrases allow relative clauses in various places. In vocative phrases which are simple names (after the vocative words), any relative clauses must come just after the names:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d5>9.5)	coi. frank. poi xunre se bende
	Hello, Frank who is-a-red team-member
	Hello, Frank from the Red Team!
</pre><p>The restrictive relative clause in <a href=#e9d5>Example 9.5 </a>suggests that there is some other Frank (perhaps on the Green Team) from whom this Frank, the one the speaker is greeting, must be distinguished.
<p>
<cx "vocative phrase with selbri, placement of relative clause on">  XE "vocative phrase with selbri: placement of relative clause on"   A vocative phrase containing a selbri can have relative clauses either before or after the selbri; both forms have the same meaning. Here are some examples:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d6>9.6)	co'o poi mi zvati ke'a ku'o xirma
	Goodbye, such-that-(I am-at IT) horse
	Goodbye, horse where I am!
<a name=e9d7>9.7)	co'o xirma poi mi zvati
	Goodbye, horse such-that-(I am-at-it).
</pre><a href=#e9d6>Example 9.6 </a>and <a href=#e9d7>Example 9.7 </a>mean the same thing. In fact, relative clauses can appear in both places.
<p>
<a name=s10><h3>Relative clauses within relative clauses</h3>
<p>
<cx "relative clauses, relative clauses within">  XE “relative clause: relative clauses within"   For the most part, these are straightforward and uncomplicated: a sumti that is part of a relative clause bridi may itself be modified by a relative clause:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d1>10.1)	le prenu poi zvati le kumfa poi blanu cu masno
	The person who is-in the room which is-blue is-slow.
</pre><cx "ke'a, meaning in relative clause inside relative clause">  XE "ke'a: meaning in relative clause inside relative clause"   <cx "relativized sumti, in relative clauses within relative clauses">  XE "relativized sumti: in relative clauses within relative clauses"   <cx "outer sumti, referring to from within relative clause within relative clause">  XE "outer sumti: referring to from within relative clause within relative clause"   <cx "inner sumti, referring to from within relative clause within relative clause">  XE "inner sumti: referring to from within relative clause within relative clause"   <cx "subscripts, use with ke'a for outer sumti reference">  XE "subscripts: use with ke'a for outer sumti reference"   <cx "ke'a with subscript, use for outer sumti reference">  XE "ke'a with subscript: use for outer sumti reference"   However, an ambiguity can exist if “ke'a” is used in a relative clause within a relative clause: does it refer to the outermost sumti, or to the sumti within the outer relative clause to which the inner relative clause is attached? The latter. To refer to the former, use a subscript on “ke'a”:
<p>
<ex "room which he built">  XE "room which he built: example“  <pre><a name=e10d2>10.2)	le prenu poi zvati le kumfa poi ke'axire zbasu ke'a cu masno
	The person who is-in the room which IT-sub-2 built IT is-slow.
	The person who is in the room which he built is slow.
</pre><lx "ke'axipa">  XE "ke'axipa"   Here, the meaning of “IT-sub-2” is that sumti attached to the second relative clause, counting from the innermost, is used. Therefore, “ke'axipa” (IT-sub-1) means the same as plain “ke'a”.
<p>
<cx "outer sumti, prenex for referring to from within relative clause within relative clause">  XE "outer sumti: prenex for referring to from within relative clause within relative clause"   <cx "prenex, use for outer sumti reference">  XE "prenex: use for outer sumti reference"   Alternatively, you can use a prenex (explained in full in <a href=chap16.html>Chapter 16</a>), which is syntactically a series of sumti followed by the special cmavo “zo'u”, prefixed to the relative clause bridi:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d3>10.3)	le prenu poi ke'a goi ko'a zo'u ko'a zvati le kumfa
		poi ke'a goi ko'e zo'u ko'a zbasu ke'a cu masno
	The man who (IT = it1 :  it1 is-in the room
		which (IT = it2 :  it1 built it2) is-slow.
</pre><a href=#e10d3>Example 10.3 </a>is more verbose than <a href=#e10d2>Example 10.2</a>, but may be clearer, since it explicitly spells out the two “ke'a” cmavo, each on its own level, and assigns them to the assignable cmavo “ko'a” and “ko'e” (explained in Chapter 6).
<p>
<a name=s11><h3>Index of relative clause cmavo</h3>
<p>
<cx "relative clauses, list of cmavo for">  XE “relative clause: list of cmavo for"   Relative clause introducers (selma'o NOI):

<p>
<cx "sumti, definition">  XE "sumti: definition"   <cx "selbri, definition">  XE "selbri: definition"   <cx "bridi", definition">  XE "bridi: definition"   <cx "sentence, basic Lojban">  XE "sentence: basic Lojban"   <cx "relationship, as basis of sentence">  XE "relationship: as basis of sentence"   <cx "relationship, objects of">  XE "relationship: objects of"   The basic type of Lojban sentence is the bridi: a claim by the speaker that certain objects are related in a certain way. The objects are expressed by Lojban grammatical forms called “sumti”; the relationship is expressed by the Lojban grammatical form called a “selbri”.
<p>
<cx "selbri, place structure of">  XE "selbri: place structure of"   <cx "place structure, definition">  XE "place structure: definition"   <cx "place structure, empty slots in">  XE "place structure: empty slots in"   <cx "sumti, as objects in place structure slots">  XE "sumti: as objects in place structure slots"   The sumti are not randomly associated with the selbri, but according to a systematic pattern known as the “place structure” of the selbri. This chapter describes the various ways in which the place structure of Lojban bridi is expressed and by which it can be manipulated. The place structure of a selbri is a sequence of empty slots into which the sumti associated with that selbri are placed. The sumti are said to occupy the places of the selbri.
<p>
<cx "place structure of selbri, determining">  XE "place structure of selbri: determining"   For our present purposes, every selbri is assumed to have a well-known place structure. If the selbri is a brivla, the place structure can be looked up in a dictionary (or, if the brivla is a lujvo not in any dictionary, inferred from the principles of lujvo construction as explained in <a href=chap12.html>Chapter 12</a>); if the selbri is a tanru, the place structure is the same as that of the final component in the tanru.
<p>
<lx "klama">  XE "klama"   <cx "klama, place structure of">  XE "klama: place structure of"   <cx "place structure, notation conventions">  XE "place structure: notation conventions"   <cx "x1, in place structure notation">  XE "x1: in place structure notation"   <ex "go">  XE "go: example“  The stock example of a place structure is that of the gismu “klama”:
klama:  <p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>x1 comes/goes to destination x2 from origin x3 via route x4
employing means of transport x5
</dl><p>The “x1 <dots>…</dots>x5” indicates that “klama” is a five-place predicate, and show the natural order (as assigned by the language engineers) of those places: agent, destination, origin, route, means.
<p>
<cx "place structure, instability of">  XE "place structure: instability of"   The place structures of brivla are not absolutely stable aspects of the language. The work done so far has attempted to establish a basic place structure on which all users can, at first, agree. In the light of actual experience with the individual selbri of the language, there will inevitably be some degree of change to the brivla place structures.
<p>
<a name=s2><h3>Standard bridi form: “cu”</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	cu	CU	prefixed selbri separator
</pre><cx "bridi, building from selbri and sumti">  XE "bridi: building from selbri and sumti"   The most usual way of constructing a bridi from a selbri such as “klama” and an appropriate number of sumti is to place the sumti intended for the x1 place before the selbri, and all the other sumti in order after the selbri, thus:
<p>
<ex "Boston from Atlanta">  XE "Boston from Atlanta: example“  <ex "go to Boston from Atlanta">  XE "go to Boston from Atlanta: example“  <pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	mi cu klama la bastn. la .atlantas. le dargu le karce
	I go to-Boston from-Atlanta via-the road using-the car.
</pre><p>Here the sumti are assigned to the places as follows:

<p>
<pre> 		x1	agent	mi
		x2	destination	la bastn.
		x3	origin	la .atlantas.
		x4	route	le dargu
		x5	means	le karce
</pre>(Note: Many of the examples in the rest of this chapter will turn out to have the same meaning as <a href=#e2d1>Example 2.1</a>; this fact will not be reiterated.)
<p>
<cx "bridi, standard form of">  XE "bridi: standard form of"   <cx "standard bridi form, definition">  XE "standard bridi form: definition"   <cx "bridi, non-standard form">  XE "bridi: non-standard form"   This ordering, with the x1 place before the selbri and all other places in natural order after the selbri, is called “standard bridi form”, and is found in the bulk of Lojban bridi, whether used in main sentences or in subordinate clauses. However, many other forms are possible, such as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d2>2.2)	mi la bastn. la .atlantas. le dargu le karce cu klama
	I, to-Boston from-Atlanta via-the road using-the car, go.
</pre><cx "bridi, effect of alternate form on sumti order">  XE "bridi: effect of alternate form on sumti order"   Here the selbri is at the end; all the sumti are placed before it. However, the same order is maintained.
<p>
Similarly, we may split up the sumti, putting some before the selbri and others after it:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d3>2.3)	mi la bastn. cu klama la .atlantas. le dargu le karce
	I to-Boston go from-Atlanta via-the road using-the car.
</pre><cx "bridi, effect of using non-standard form">  XE "bridi: effect of using non-standard form"   <cx "emphasis, changing by using non-standard form of bridi">  XE "emphasis: changing by using non-standard form of bridi"   All of the variant forms in this section and following sections can be used to place emphasis on the part or parts which have been moved out of their standard places. Thus, <a href=#e2d2>Example 2.2 </a>places emphasis on the selbri (because it is at the end); <a href=#e2d3>Example 2.3 </a>emphasizes “la bastn.”, because it has been moved before the selbri. Moving more than one component may dilute this emphasis. It is permitted, but no stylistic significance has yet been established for drastic reordering.
<p>
<lx "cu">  XE "cu"   <lx "CU">  XE "CU selma’o"   <cx "cu, as selbri separator">  XE "cu: as selbri separator"   <cx "cu, necessity of">  XE "cu: necessity of"   <cx "cu, usefulness of">  XE "cu: usefulness of"   <cx "cu, effect on elidable terminators">  XE "cu: effect on elidable terminators"   In all these examples, the cmavo “cu” (belonging to selma'o CU) is used to separate the selbri from any preceding sumti. It is never absolutely necessary to use “cu”. However, providing it helps the reader or listener to locate the selbri quickly, and may make it possible to place a complex sumti just before the selbri, allowing the speaker to omit elidable terminators, possibly a whole stream of them, that would otherwise be necessary.
<p>
<cx "sumti, order in selbri">  XE "sumti: order in selbri"   <cx "sumti, order in selbri-first bridi">  XE "sumti: order in selbri-first bridi"   <cx "sumti, omitted first place in selbri-first bridi">  XE "sumti: omitted first place in selbri-first bridi"   <cx "selbri-first bridi, effect on sumti places">  XE "selbri-first bridi: effect on sumti places"   <cx "bridi, selbri-first as exceptional">  XE "bridi: selbri-first as exceptional"   The general rule, then, is that the selbri may occur anywhere in the bridi as long as the sumti maintain their order. The only exception (and it is an important one) is that if the selbri appears first, the x1 sumti is taken to have been omitted:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d4>2.4)	klama la bastn. la .atlantas. le dargu le karce
	A-goer to-Boston from-Atlanta via-the road using-the car.
	Goes to-Boston from-Atlanta via-the road using-the car.
	Look:  a goer to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car!
</pre><cx "bridi, omitting the first sumti place">  XE "bridi: omitting the first sumti place"   <cx "bridi, exception to sumti place structure in">  XE "bridi: exception to sumti place structure in"   <cx "observative, definition">  XE "observative: definition"   <cx "observative form, contrasted with command">  XE "observative form: contrasted with command"   <cx "command, contrasted with observative form">  XE "command: contrasted with observative form"   Here the x1 place is empty: the listener must guess from context who is going to Boston. In <a href=#e2d4>Example 2.4</a>, “klama” is glossed “a goer” rather than “go” because “Go” at the beginning of an English sentence would suggest a command: “Go to Boston!”. <a href=#e2d4>Example 2.4 </a>is not a command, simply a normal statement with the x1 place unspecified, causing the emphasis to fall on the selbri “klama”. Such a bridi, with empty x1, is called an “observative”, because it usually calls on the listener to observe something in the environment which would belong in the x1 place. The third translation above shows this observative nature. Sometimes it is the relationship itself which the listener is asked to observe.
<p>
(There is a way to both provide a sumti for the x1 place and put the selbri first in the bridi: see <a href=#e3d7>Example 3.7</a>.)
<p>
<cx "unspecified trailing sumti, dropping">  XE "unspecified trailing sumti: dropping"   <cx "sumti, dropping trailing unspecified">  XE "sumti: dropping trailing unspecified"   <cx "bridi, leaving end sumti places unspecified in">  XE "bridi: leaving end sumti places unspecified in"   Suppose the speaker desires to omit a place other than the x1 place? (Presumably it is obvious or, for one reason or another, not worth saying.) Places at the end may simply be dropped:
<p>
<ex "unspecified route">  XE "unspecified route: example“  <pre><a name=e2d5>2.5)	mi klama la bastn. la .atlantas.
	I go to-Boston from-Atlanta (via an unspecified route, using an unspecified

</pre><cx "unspecified sumti, non-trailing">  XE "unspecified sumti: non-trailing"   <a href=#e2d5>Example 2.5 </a>has empty x4 and x5 places: the speaker does not specify the route or the means of transport. However, simple omission will not work for a place when the places around it are to be specified: in

<pre><a name=e2d6>2.6)	mi klama la bastn. la .atlantas. le karce
	I go to-Boston from-Atlanta via-the car.
</pre>“le karce” occupies the x4 place, and therefore <a href=#e2d6>Example 2.6 </a>means:
<p>

</dl><p>This is nonsense, since a car cannot be a route. What the speaker presumably meant is expressed by:

<p>
<a name=s3><h3>Tagging places: FA</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	fa	FA	tags x1 place
	fe	FA	tags x2 place
	fi	FA	tags x3 place
	fo	FA	tags x4 place
	fu	FA	tags x5 place
	fi'a	FA	place structure question
</pre><lx "FA">  XE "FA selma’o"   <lx "fa">  XE "fa"   <lx "fe">  XE "fe"   <lx "fi">  XE "fi"   <lx "fo">  XE "fo"   <lx "fu">  XE "fu"   <cx "FA, syntax of">  XE "FA selma’o: syntax of"   In sentences like <a href=#e2d1>Example 2.1</a>, it is easy to get lost and forget which sumti falls in which place, especially if the sumti are more complicated than simple names or descriptions. The place structure tags of selma'o FA may be used to help clarify place structures. The five cmavo “fa”, “fe”, “fi”, “fo”, and “fu” may be inserted just before the sumti in the x1 to x5 places respectively:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d1>3.1)	fa mi cu klama fe la bastn. fi la .atlantas. fo le dargu fu le karce
	x1= I  go  x2= Boston  x3= Atlanta  x4= the road  x5= the car.
	I go to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.
</pre><cx "FA, effect on place structure">  XE "FA selma’o: effect on place structure"   <cx "place structure, effect of FA on">  XE "place structure: effect of FA on"   <cx "place structure, explicitly mapping sumti to place with FA">  XE "place structure: explicitly mapping sumti to place with FA"   <cx "sumti, explicitly mapping into place structure with FA">  XE "sumti: explicitly mapping into place structure with FA"   <cx "FA, for accessing a selbri place explicitly by relative number">  XE "FA selma’o: for accessing a selbri place explicitly by relative number"   In <a href=#e3d1>Example 3.1</a>, the tag “fu” before “le karce” clarifies that “le karce” occupies the x5 place of “klama”. The use of “fu” tells us nothing about the purpose or meaning of the x5 place; it simply says that “le karce” occupies it.
<p>
In <a href=#e3d1>Example 3.1</a>, the tags are overkill; they serve only to make <a href=#e2d1>Example 2.1 </a>even longer than it is. Here is a better illustration of the use of FA tags for clarification:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d2>3.2)	fa mi klama fe le zdani be mi be'o poi nurma vau fi la nu,IORK.
	x1= I  go   x2= (the house of me) which is-rural   x3= New York.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e3d2>Example 3.2</a>, the place structure of “klama” is as follows:
<p>
<pre>	  x1	agent	mi
	  x2	destination	le zdani be mi be'o poi nurma vau
	  x3	origin	la nu,IORK.
	  x4	route	(empty)
	  x5	means	(empty)
</pre><cx "FA, as a reminder of place in place structure">  XE "FA selma’o: as a reminder of place in place structure"   The “fi” tag serves to remind the hearer that what follows is in the x3 place of “klama”; after listening to the complex sumti occupying the x2 place, it's easy to get lost.
<p>
<cx "FA, effect on place structure order">  XE "FA selma’o: effect on place structure order"   <cx "place structure order, effect of FA on">  XE "place structure order: effect of FA on"   <cx "selbri-first bridi, specifying first sumti place in with fa">  XE "selbri-first bridi: specifying first sumti place in with fa"   <cx "sumti, re-ordering with FA">  XE "sumti: re-ordering with FA"   Of course, once the sumti have been tagged, the order in which they are specified no longer carries the burden of distinguishing the places. Therefore, it is perfectly all right to scramble them into any order desired, and to move the selbri to anywhere in the bridi, even the beginning:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d3>3.3)	klama fa mi fi la .atlantas. fu le karce fe la bastn. fo le dargu
	go  x1= I  x3= Atlanta  x5= the car  x2= Boston  x4= the road.
	Go I from Atlanta using the car to Boston via the road.
</pre><lx "cu">  XE "cu"   <cx "cu, effect of selbri-first bridi on">  XE "cu: effect of selbri-first bridi on"   <cx "selbri-first bridi, effect on use of cu">  XE "selbri-first bridi: effect on use of cu"   Note that no “cu” is permitted before the selbri in <a href=#e3d3>Example 3.3</a>, because “cu” separates the selbri from any preceding sumti, and <a href=#e3d3>Example 3.3 </a>has no such sumti.
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d4>3.4)	fu le karce fo le dargu fi la .atlantas. fe la bastn. cu klama fa mi
	x5= the car  x4= the road  x3= Atlanta  x2= Boston  go  x1=I
	Using the car, via the road, from Atlanta to Boston go I.
</pre><a href=#e3d4>Example 3.4 </a>exhibits the reverse of the standard bridi form seen in <a href=#e2d{1}>Examples 2.1 </a>and <a href=#e3d1>3.1</a>, but still means exactly the same thing. If the FA tags were left out, however, producing:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d5>3.5)	le karce le dargu la .atlantas. la bastn. cu klama mi
	The car to-the road from-Atlanta via-Boston goes using-me.
	The car goes to the road from Atlanta, with Boston as the route, using me
as a means of transport.
</pre>the meaning would be wholly changed, and in fact nonsensical.
<p>
<cx "place structures, omitting places with FA">  XE "place structure: omitting places with FA"   <cx "FA, compared with zo'e for omitting places">  XE "FA selma’o: compared with zo'e for omitting places"   <cx "zo'e, compared with FA for omitting places">  XE "zo'e: compared with FA for omitting places"   Tagging places with FA cmavo makes it easy not only to reorder the places but also to omit undesirable ones, without any need for “zo'e” or special rules about the x1 place:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d6>3.6)	klama fi la .atlantas. fe la bastn. fu le karce
	A-goer  x3= Atlanta  x2= Boston  x5 = the car.
	A goer from Atlanta to Boston using the car.
</pre><p>Here the x1 and x4 places are empty, and so no sumti are tagged with “fa” or “fo”; in addition, the x2 and x3 places appear in reverse order.
<p>
<cx "FA, effect on subsequent non-tagged places">  XE "FA selma’o: effect on subsequent non-tagged places"   What if some sumti have FA tags and others do not? The rule is that after a FA-tagged sumti, any sumti following it occupy the places numerically succeeding it, subject to the proviso that an already-filled place is skipped:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d7>3.7)	klama fa mi la bastn. la .atlantas. le dargu le karce
	Go  x1= I  x2= Boston  x3= Atlanta  x4= the road  x5= the car.
	Go I to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e3d7>Example 3.7</a>, the “fa” causes “mi” to occupy the x1 place, and then the following untagged sumti occupy in order the x2 through x5 places. This is the mechanism by which Lojban allows placing the selbri first while specifying a sumti for the x1 place.
<p>
Here is a more complex (and more confusing) example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d8>3.8)	mi klama fi la .atlantas. le dargu fe la bastn. le karce
	I  go  x3= Atlanta, the road  x2= Boston, the car.
	I go from Atlanta via the road to Boston using the car.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e3d8>Example 3.8</a>, “mi” occupies the x1 place because it is the first sumti in the sentence (and is before the selbri). The second sumti, “la .atlantas.”, occupies the x3 place by virtue of the tag “fi”, and “le dargu” occupies the x4 place as a result of following “la .atlantas.”. Finally, “la bastn.” occupies the x2 place because of its tag “fe”, and “le karce” skips over the already-occupied x3 and x4 places to land in the x5 place.
<p>
<cx "FA, avoidance of complex usage of">  XE "FA selma’o: avoidance of complex usage of"   Such a convoluted use of tags should probably be avoided except when trying for a literal translation of some English (or other natural-language) sentence; the rules stated here are merely given so that some standard interpretation is possible.
<p>
<cx "FA, for putting more than one sumti in a single place">  XE "FA selma’o: for putting more than one sumti in a single place"   <cx "sumti, multiple in one place with FA">  XE "sumti: multiple in one place with FA"   <cx "multiple sumti in one place, meaning">  XE "multiple sumti in one place: meaning"   It is grammatically permitted to tag more than one sumti with the same FA cmavo. The effect is that of making more than one claim:
<p>
<ex "to movie, house, office">  XE "to movie: house, office, example“  <pre><a name=e3d9>3.9)	[fa] la rik. fa la djein. klama [fe] le skina fe le zdani fe le zarci
	[x1=] Rick  x1= Jane  goes-to  x2= the movie  x2= the house  x2= the office
</pre><cx "multiple sumti in one place, avoiding">  XE "multiple sumti in one place: avoiding"   may be taken to say that both Rick and Jane go to the movie, the house, and the office, merging six claims into one. More likely, however, it will simply confuse the listener. There are better ways, involving logical connectives (explained in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>), to say such things in Lojban. In fact, putting more than one sumti into a place is odd enough that it can only be done by explicit FA usage: this is the motivation for the proviso above, that already-occupied places are skipped. In this way, no sumti can be forced into a place already occupied unless it has an explicit FA cmavo tagging it.
<p>
<lx "fi'a">  XE "fi'a"   <cx "place structure questions">  XE "place structure questions"   <cx "questions, place structure position">  XE "questions: place structure position"   The cmavo “fi'a” also belongs to selma'o FA, and allows Lojban users to ask questions about place structures. A bridi containing “fi'a” is a question, asking the listener to supply the appropriate other member of FA which will make the bridi a true statement:
<p>
<ex "give or receive?">  XE "give or receive?: example“   <pre><a name=e3d10>3.10)	fi'a do dunda [fe] le vi rozgu
	[what place]? you give x2= the nearby rose
	In what way are you involved in the giving of this rose?
	Are you the giver or the receiver of this rose?
</pre><p>In <a href=#e3d10>Example 3.10</a>, the speaker uses the selbri “dunda”, whose place structure is:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>dunda:  <dd>x1 gives x2 to x3
</dl><cx "answer, to place structure question">  XE "answers: to place structure questions"   The tagged sumti “fi'a do” indicates that the speaker wishes to know whether the sumti “do” falls in the x1 or the x3 place (the x2 place is already occupied by “le rozgu”). The listener can reply with a sentence consisting solely of a FA cmavo: “fa” if the listener is the giver, “fi” if he/she is the receiver.
<p>
<cx "fi'a, effect on subsequent untagged sumti">  XE "fi'a: effect on subsequent untagged sumti"   I have inserted the tag “fe” in brackets into <a href=#e3d10>Example 3.10</a>, but it is actually not necessary, because “fi'a” does not count as a numeric tag; therefore, “le vi rozgu” would necessarily be in the x2 place even if no tag were present, because it immediately follows the selbri.
<p>
There is also another member of FA, namely “fai”, which is discussed in <a href=#s12>Section 12</a>.
<p>
<a name=s4><h3>Conversion: SE</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre>	se	SE	2nd place conversion
	te	SE	3rd place conversion
	ve	SE	4th place conversion
	xe	SE	5th place conversion
</pre><cx "converted selbri, definition">  XE "converted selbri: definition"   <cx "converted selbri, forming with SE">  XE "converted selbri: forming with SE"   <cx "converted selbri, place structure of">  XE "converted selbri: place structure of"   <cx "converted selbri, as different selbri from unconverted">  XE "converted selbri: as different selbri from unconverted"   <lx "SE">  XE "SE selma’o"   <cx "SE, effect on selbri place structure">  XE "SE selma’o: effect on selbri place structure"   <lx "se">  XE "se"   <cx "SE, for converting place structure">  XE "SE selma’o: for converting place structure"   So far we have seen ways to move sumti around within a bridi, but the actual place structure of the selbri has always remained untouched. The conversion cmavo of selma'o SE are incorporated within the selbri itself, and produce a new selbri (called a converted selbri) with a different place structure. In particular, after the application of any SE cmavo, the number and purposes of the places remain the same, but two of them have been exchanged, the x1 place and another. Which place has been exchanged with x1 depends on the cmavo chosen. Thus, for example, when “se” is used, the x1 place is swapped with the x2 place.
<p>
<cx "SE, rationale for no 1st place conversion">  XE "SE selma’o: rationale for no 1st place conversion"   <cx "SE, word formation of cmavo in">  XE "SE selma’o: word formation of cmavo in"   Note that the cmavo of SE begin with consecutive consonants in alphabetical order. There is no “1st place conversion” cmavo, because exchanging the x1 place with itself is a pointless maneuver.
<p>
<cx "se klama, place structure of">  XE "se klama: place structure of"   Here are the place structures of “se klama”:

Structurally, however, they are quite different. <a href=#e4d1>Example 4.1 </a>has “la bastn.” in the x1 place and “mi” in the x2 place of the selbri “se klama”, and uses standard bridi order; <a href=#e4d2>Example 4.2 </a>has “mi” in the x1 place and “la bastn.” in the x2 place of the selbri “klama”, and uses a non-standard order.
<p>
<cx "converted selbri, in descriptions">  XE "converted selbri: in descriptions"   <lx "LA">  XE "LA selma’o"   <lx "LE">  XE "LE selma’o"   The most important use of conversion is in the construction of descriptions. A description is a sumti which begins with a cmavo of selma'o LA or LE, called the descriptor, and contains (in the simplest case) a selbri. We have already seen the descriptions “le dargu” and “le karce”. To this we could add:
<p>
<ex "the go-er">  XE "the go-er: example“  <pre><a name=e4d3>4.3)	le klama
	the go-er, the one who goes
</pre><cx "descriptions, as based on first place of following selbri">  XE "descriptions: as based on first place of following selbri"   <cx "descriptions, use of SE in">  XE "descriptions: use of SE in"   <cx "converted selbri, to access non-first place in description">  XE "converted selbri: to access non-first place in description"   In every case, the description is about something which fits into the x1 place of the selbri. In order to get a description of a destination (that is, something fitting the x2 place of “klama”), we must convert the selbri to “se klama”, whose x1 place is a destination. The result is
<p>
<ex "the destination">  XE "the destination: example“  <pre><a name=e4d4>4.4)	le se klama
	the destination gone to by someone
</pre><p>Likewise, we can create three more converted descriptions:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d5>4.5)	le te klama
	the origin of someone's going
<a name=e4d6>4.6)	le ve klama
	the route of someone's going
<a name=e4d7>4.7)	le xe klama
	the means by which someone goes

It means a route that is used by someone for an act of “klama”; that is, a journey with origin and destination. A “road” on Mars, on which no one has traveled or is ever likely to, may be called “le pluta”, but it cannot be “le ve klama”, since there exists no one for whom it is “le ve klama be fo da” (the route taken in an actual journey by someone [da]).

In order to convert an entire tanru, it is necessary to enclose the tanru in “ke<dots>…</dots>ke'e” brackets:
<p>
<ex "blue house">  XE "blue house: example“  <pre><a name=e4d8>4.8)	mi se ke blanu zdani [ke'e] ti
	I [2nd conversion] blue house this-thing
</pre><p>The place structure of “blanu zdani” (blue house) is the same as that of “zdani”, by the rule given in <a href=#s1>Section 1</a>. The place structure of “zdani” is:
zdani:  <p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>x1 is a house/nest/lair/den for inhabitant x2
</dl><p>The place structure of “se ke blanu zdani [ke'e]” is therefore:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>x1 is the inhabitant of the blue house (etc.) x2
</dl><p>Consequently, <a href=#e4d8>Example 4.8 </a>means:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>I am the inhabitant of the blue house which is this thing.
</dl><p>Conversion applied to only part of a tanru has subtler effects which are explained in <a href=chap5.html>Chapter 5</a>.
<p>
<cx "SE, effect of multiple on a selbri">  XE "SE selma’o: effect of multiple on a selbri"   <cx "multiple SE, effect of ordering">  XE "multiple SE: effect of ordering"   <cx "conversion, effect of multiple on a selbri">  XE "conversion: effect of multiple on a selbri"   <cx "multiple conversion, effect of ordering">  XE "multiple conversion: effect of ordering"   It is grammatical to convert a selbri more than once with SE; later (inner) conversions are applied before earlier (outer) ones. For example, the place structure of “se te klama” is achieved by exchanging the x1 and x2 place of “te klama”, producing:
<p>
<lx "se te">  XE "se te"   <dl compact><dt><dd>x1 is the destination and x2 is the origin of x3 going via x4 using x5
</dl><p>On the other hand, “te se klama” has a place structure derived from swapping the x1 and x3 places of “se klama”:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>x1 is the origin of x2's going to x3 via x4 using x5
</dl><cx "multiple conversion, avoiding">  XE "multiple conversion: avoiding"   which is quite different. However, multiple conversions like this are never necessary. Arbitrary scrambling of places can be achieved more easily and far more intelligibly with FA tags, and only a single conversion is ever needed in a description.
<p>
<cx "conversion, swapping non-first places">  XE "conversion: swapping non-first places"   <lx "setese">  XE "setese"   (Although no one has made any real use of it, it is perhaps worth noting that compound conversions of the form “setese”, where the first and third cmavo are the same, effectively swap the two given places while leaving the others, including x1, alone: “setese” (or equivalently “tesete”) swap the x2 and x3 places, whereas “texete” (or “xetexe”) swap the x3 and x5 places.)
<p>
<a name=s5><h3>Modal places: FIhO, FEhU</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	fi'o	FIhO	modal place prefix
	fe'u	FEhU	modal terminator
</pre><p>Sometimes the place structures engineered into Lojban are inadequate to meet the needs of actual speech. Consider the gismu “viska”, whose place structure is:
<p>
<lx "viska">  XE "viska"   <dl compact><dt><dd>viska:  x1 sees x2 under conditions x3
</dl><p>Seeing is a threefold relationship, involving an agent (le viska), an object of sight (le se viska), and an environment that makes seeing possible (le te viska). Seeing is done with one or more eyes, of course; in general, the eyes belong to the entity in the x1 place.
<p>
<ex "see with left eye">  XE "see with left eye: example“  <cx "fi'o, as modal tag">  XE "fi'o: as modal tag"   <cx "place structure, adding new places to with modal sumti">  XE "place structure: adding new places to with modal sumti"   <cx "fi'o, use in adding places to place structure">  XE "fi'o: use in adding places to place structure"   <lx "fi'o">  XE "fi'o"   <lx "FIhO">  XE "FIhO selma’o"   <lx "fe'u">  XE "fe'u"   <lx "FEhU">  XE "FEhU selma’o"   Suppose, however, that you are blind in one eye and are talking to someone who doesn't know that. You might want to say, “I see you with the left eye.” There is no place in the place structure of “viska” such as “with eye x4” or the like. Lojban allows you to solve the problem by adding a new place, changing the relationship:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	mi viska do fi'o kanla [fe'u] le zunle
	I see you [modal] eye:  the left-thing
	I see you with the left eye.

The combination of the cmavo “fi'o” (of selma'o FIhO) followed by a selbri, in this case the gismu “kanla”, forms a tag which is prefixed to the sumti filling the new place, namely “le zunle”. The semantics of “fi'o kanla le zunle” is that “le zunle” fills the x1 place of “kanla”, whose place structure is

The x2 place of “kanla” is unspecified and must be inferred from the context. It is important to remember that even though “le zunle” is placed following “fi'o kanla”, semantically it belongs in the x1 place of “kanla”. The selbri may be terminated with “fe'u” (of selma'o FEhU), an elidable terminator which is rarely required unless a non-logical connective follows the tag (omitting “fe'u” in that case would make the connective affect the selbri).

(This use of the word “modal” is specific to the Loglan Project, and does not agree with the standard uses in either logic or linguistics, but is now too entrenched to change easily.) The “fi'o” construction marking a modal place is called a “modal tag”, and the sumti which follows it a “modal sumti”; the purely Lojban terms “sumti tcita” and “seltcita sumti”, respectively, are also commonly used. Modal sumti may be placed anywhere within the bridi, in any order; they have no effect whatever on the rules for assigning unmarked bridi to numbered places, and they may not be marked with FA cmavo.
<p>
Consider <a href=#e5d1>Example 5.1 </a>again. Another way to view the situation is to consider the speaker's left eye as a tool, a tool for seeing. The relevant selbri then becomes “pilno”, whose place structure is
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>pilno:  x1 uses x2 as a tool for purpose x3
</dl>and we can rewrite <a href=#e5d1>Example 5.1 </a>as
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d2>5.2)	mi viska do fi'o se pilno le zunle kanla
	I see you [modal] [conversion] use:  the left eye
	I see you using my left eye.
</pre><p>Here the selbri belonging to the modal is “se pilno”. The conversion of “pilno” is necessary in order to get the “tool” place into x1, since only x1 can be the modal sumti. The “tool user” place is the x2 of “se pilno” (because it is the x1 of “pilno”) and remains unspecified. The tag “fi'o pilno” would mean “with tool user”, leaving the tool unspecified.
<p>
<a name=s6><h3>Modal tags: BAI</h3>
<p>
There are certain selbri which seem particularly useful in constructing modal tags. In particular, “pilno” is one of them. The place structure of “pilno” is:
<p>
pilno:  x1 uses x2 as a tool for purpose x3
</dl><lx "sepi'o">  XE "sepi'o"   <cx "BAI modal tags, rationale for">  XE "BAI modal tags: rationale for"   and almost any selbri which represents an action may need to specify a tool. Having to say “fi'o se pilno” frequently would make many Lojban sentences unnecessarily verbose and clunky, so an abbreviation is provided in the language design: the compound cmavo “sepi'o”.
<p>
<lx "pi'o">  XE "pi'o"   <lx "BAI">  XE "BAI selma’o"   <cx "BAI, as short forms for fi'o constructs">  XE "BAI selma’o: as short forms for fi'o constructs"   <cx "fi'o constructs, short forms as BAI cmavo">  XE "fi'o constructs: short forms as BAI"   <cx "modal tags, short forms as BAI cmavo">  XE "modal tag: short form as BAI"   <cx "conversion, of BAI cmavo">  XE "conversion: of BAI"   <lx "SE">  XE "SE selma’o"   Here “se” is used before a cmavo, namely “pi'o”, rather than before a brivla. The meaning of this cmavo, which belongs to selma'o BAI, is exactly the same as that of “fi'o pilno fe'u”. Since what we want is a tag based on “se pilno” rather than “pilno” — the tool, not the tool user — the grammar allows a BAI cmavo to be converted using a SE cmavo. <a href=#e5d2>Example 5.2 </a>may therefore be rewritten as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d1>6.1)	mi viska do sepi'o le zunle kanla
	I see you with-tool:  the left eye
	I see you using my left eye.
</pre><p>The compound cmavo “sepi'o” is much shorter than “fi'o se pilno [fe'u]” and can be thought of as a single word meaning “with-tool”. The modal tag “pi'o”, with no “se”, similarly means “with-tool-user”, probably a less useful concept. Nevertheless, the parallelism with the place structure of “pilno” makes the additional syllable worthwhile.

<lx "ka'a">  XE "ka'a"   <cx "BAI, effect of conversion on">  XE "BAI selma’o: effect of conversion on"   <cx "conversion, effect on BAI">  XE "conversion: effect on BAI"   Some BAI cmavo make sense with as well as without a SE cmavo; for example, “ka'a”, the BAI corresponding to the gismu “klama”, has five usable forms corresponding to the five places of “klama” respectively:
<p>
<pre> 	ka'a	with-goer
	seka'a	with-destination
	teka'a	with-origin
	veka'a	with-route
	xeka'a	with-means-of-transport
</pre><p>Any of these tags may be used to provide modal places for bridi, as in the following examples:
<p>
<ex "traveling salesperson">  XE "traveling salesperson: example“  <ex "Avon">  XE "Avon: example“  <pre><a name=e6d2>6.2)	la .eivn. cu vecnu loi flira cinta ka'a mi
	Avon sells a-mass-of face paint with-goer me.
	I am a traveling cosmetics salesperson for Avon.
</pre>(<a href=#e6d2>Example 6.2 </a>may seem a bit strained, but it illustrates the way in which an existing selbri, “vecnu” in this case, may have a place added to it which might otherwise seem utterly unrelated.)

The list is somewhat biased toward English, because many of the cmavo were selected on the basis of corresponding English prepositions and preposition compounds such as “with”, “without”, and “by means of”. The BAI cmavo, however, are far more precise than English prepositions, because their meanings are fixed by the place structures of the corresponding gismu.
<p>
<cx "BAI, form of cmavo in">  XE "BAI selma’o: form of cmavo in"   All BAI cmavo have the form CV'V or CVV. Most of them are CV'V, where the C is the first consonant of the corresponding gismu and the two Vs are the two vowels of the gismu. The table in <a href=#s16>Section 16 </a>shows the exceptions.

This cmavo is used when an extra place is needed, but it seems useful to be vague about the semantic implications of the extra place:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d7>6.7)	lo nanmu be do'e le berti cu klama le tcadu

This construction is useful when the selbri of a description requires a modal place; this and other uses of “be” are more fully explained in <a href=chap5.html>Chapter 5</a>.

<a name=s7><h3>Modal sentence connection: the causals</h3>

	ki'u	BAI	krinu modal:  justification
	mu'i	BAI	mukti modal:  motivation
	ni'i	BAI	nibli modal:  logical entailment
</pre><p>This section has two purposes. On the one hand, it explains the grammatical construct called “modal sentence connection”. On the other, it exemplifies some of the more useful BAI cmavo: the causals. (There are other BAI cmavo which have causal implications: “ja'e” means “with result”, and so “seja'e” means “with cause of unspecified nature”; likewise, “gau” means “with agent” and “tezu'e” means “with purpose”. These other modal cmavo will not be further discussed here, as my purpose is to explain modal sentence connection rather than Lojbanic views of causation.)
<p>
<cx "causals, gismu">  XE "causals: gismu"   There are four causal gismu in Lojban, distinguishing different versions of the relationships lumped in English as “causal”:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>rinka:  event x1 physically causes event x2
krinu:  event x1 is the justification for event x2
mukti:  event x1 is the (human) motive for event x2
nibli:  event x1 logically entails event x2
</dl><cx "modals, for causal gismu">  XE "modals: for causal gismu"   <cx "causals, modal">  XE "causals: modal"   <cx "modal causals, implication differences">  XE "modal causals: implication differences"   Each of these gismu has a related modal: “ri'a”, “ki'u”, “mu'i”, and “ni'i” respectively. Using these gismu and these modals, we can create various causal sentences with different implications:
<p>
<ex "plant grows">  XE "plant grows: example“  <pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	le spati cu banro ri'a le nu do djacu dunda

	The plant grows with-physical-cause the event-of you water give

	John got the first prize because he won.

	Socrates dead-became with-logical-justification Socrates is-human.
	Socrates died because Socrates is human.
</pre><cx "“because”, four varieties of">  XE "because: English word, four varieties of"   In <a href=#e7d{1}>Examples 7.1 </a>through <a href=#e7d4>7.4</a>, the same English word “because” is used to translate all four modals, but the types of cause being expressed are quite different. Let us now focus on <a href=#e7d1>Example 7.1</a>, and explore some variations on it.
<p>
<cx "abstraction bridi, effect on claim of bridi">  XE "abstraction bridi: effect on claim of bridi"   <cx "causals, claiming the relation contrasted with claiming cause and/or effect and/or relation">  XE "causals: claiming the relation contrasted with claiming cause and/or effect and/or relation"   As written, <a href=#e7d1>Example 7.1 </a>claims that the plant grows, but only refers to the event of watering it in an abstraction bridi (abstractions are explained in <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11</a>) without actually making a claim. If I express <a href=#e7d1>Example 7.1</a>, I have said that the plant in fact grows, but I have not said that you actually water it, merely that there is a causal relationship between watering and growing. This is semantically asymmetrical. Suppose I wanted to claim that the plant was being watered, and only mention its growth as ancillary information? Then we could reverse the main bridi and the abstraction bridi, saying:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d5>7.5)	do djacu dunda fi le spati seri'a le nu ri banro
	You water-give to the plant with-physical-effect it grows.
	You water the plant; therefore, it grows.
</pre>with the “ri'a” changed to “seri'a”. In addition, there are also symmetrical forms:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d6>7.6)	le nu do djacu dunda fi le spati cu rinka
		le nu le spati cu banro
	The event-of (you water-give to the plant) causes
		the event-of (the plant grows).
	Your watering the plant causes its growth.
	If you water the plant, then it grows.
</pre>does not claim either event, but asserts only the causal relationship between them. So in <a href=#e7d6>Example 7.6</a>, I am not saying that the plant grows nor that you have in fact watered it. The second colloquial translation shows a form of “if-then” in English quite distinct from the logical connective “if-then” explained in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>.
<p>
Suppose we wish to claim both events as well as their causal relationship? We can use one of two methods:
<p>
<lx ".iri'abo">  XE "iri'abo"   <lx ".i">  XE "i"   <lx "bo">  XE "bo"   <cx "modal sentence connection">  XE "modal sentence connection"   <pre><a name=e7d7>7.7)	le spati cu banro  .iri'abo do djacu dunda fi le spati
	The plant grows. Because you water-give to the plant.
	The plant grows because you water it.
<a name=e7d8>7.8)	do djacu dunda fi le spati  .iseri'abo le spati cu banro
	You water-give to the plant.  Therefore it grows.
	You water the plant; therefore, it grows.
</pre><p>The compound cmavo “.iri'abo” and “.iseri'abo” serve to connect two bridi, as the initial “.i” indicates. The final “bo” is necessary to prevent the modal from “taking over” the following sumti. If the “bo” were omitted from <a href=#e7d7>Example 7.7 </a>we would have:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d9>7.9)	le spati cu banro  .i ri'a do djacu dunda fi le spati
	The plant grows.  Because of you, [something] water-gives to the plant.
	The plant grows. Because of you, water is given to the plant.
</pre><p>Because “ri'a do” is a modal sumti in <a href=#e7d9>Example 7.9</a>, there is no longer an explicit sumti in the x1 place of “djacu dunda”, and the translation must be changed.
<p>
<cx "modal sentence connection, effect on modal">  XE "modal sentence connection: effect on modal"   <cx "modal sentence connection, relation to modal of first sentence in">  XE "modal sentence connection: relation to modal of first sentence in"   <cx "modal sentence connection, relation to modal of second sentence in">  XE "modal sentence connection: relation to modal of second sentence in"   The effect of sentences like <a href=#e7d7>Example 7.7 </a>and <a href=#e7d8>Example 7.8 </a>is that the modal, “ri'a” in this example, no longer modifies an explicit sumti. Instead, the sumti is implicit, the event given by a full bridi. Furthermore, there is a second implication: that the first bridi fills the x2 place of the gismu “rinka”; it specifies an event which is the effect. I am therefore claiming three things: that the plant grows, that you have watered it, and that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the two.
<p>
<cx "modal sentence connection, with other than causals">  XE "modal sentence connection: with other than causals"   In principle, any modal tag can appear in a sentence connective of the type exemplified by <a href=#e7d7>Example 7.7 </a>and <a href=#e7d8>Example 7.8</a>. However, it makes little sense to use any modals which do not expect events or other abstractions to fill the places of the corresponding gismu. The sentence connective “.ibaubo” is perfectly grammatical, but it is hard to imagine any two sentences which could be connected by an “in-language” modal. This is because a sentence describes an event, and an event can be a cause or an effect, but not a language.
<p>
<a name=s8><h3>Other modal connections</h3>
<p>
Like many Lojban grammatical constructions, sentence modal connection has both forethought and afterthought forms. (See <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14 </a>for a more detailed discussion of Lojban connectives.) <a href=#s7>Section 7 </a>exemplifies only afterthought modal connection, illustrated here by:
<p>
<ex "grasp water">  XE "grasp water: example“  <pre><a name=e8d1>8.1)	mi jgari lei djacu .iri'abo mi jgari le kabri
	I grasp the-mass-of water with-physical-cause I grasp the cup.
	Causing the mass of water to be grasped by me, I grasped the cup.
	I grasp the water because I grasp the cup.
</pre><cx "afterthought connection, definition">  XE "afterthought connection: definition"   <cx "forethought connection, definition">  XE "forethought connection: definition"   An afterthought connection is one that is signaled only by a cmavo (or a compound cmavo, in this case) between the two constructs being connected. Forethought connection uses a signal both before the first construct and between the two: the use of “both” and “and” in the first half of this sentence represents a forethought connection (though not a modal one).
<p>
<cx "forethought modal sentence connection">  XE "forethought modal sentence connection"   <cx "modal sentence connection, forethought">  XE "modal sentence connection: forethought"   <lx "gi">  XE "gi"   To make forethought modal sentence connections in Lojban, place the modal plus “gi” before the first bridi, and “gi” between the two. No “.i” is used within the construct. The forethought equivalent of <a href=#e8d1>Example 8.1 </a>is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d2>8.2)	ri'agi mi jgari le kabri gi mi jgari lei djacu
	With-physical-cause I grasp the cup, I grasp the-mass-of water.
	Because I grasp the cup, I grasp the water.
</pre><cx "forethought modal sentence connection for causals, order of cause and effect">  XE "forethought modal sentence connection for causals: order of cause and effect"   <cx "forethought modal sentence connection, relation to modal of first bridi in">  XE "forethought modal sentence connection: relation to modal of first bridi in"   <cx "forethought modal sentence connection, relation to modal of second bridi in">  XE "forethought modal sentence connection: relation to modal of second bridi in"   Note that the cause, the x1 of “rinka” is now placed first. To keep the two bridi in the original order of <a href=#e8d1>Example 8.1</a>, we could say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d3>8.3)	seri'agi mi jgari lei djacu gi mi jgari le kabri
	With-physical-effect I grasp the-mass-of water, I grasp the cup.
</pre><p>In English, the sentence “*Therefore I grasp the water, I grasp the cup” is ungrammatical, because “therefore” is not grammatically equivalent to “because”. In Lojban, “seri'agi” can be used just like “ri'agi”.
<p>
<cx "modal sentence connection, condensing">  XE "modal sentence connection: condensing"   When the two bridi joined by a modal connection have one or more elements (selbri or sumti or both) in common, there are various condensed forms that can be used in place of full modal sentence connection with both bridi completely stated.
<p>
<cx "modal sumti connection">  XE "modal sumti connection"   <cx "sumti modal connection">  XE "sumti modal connection"   When the bridi are the same except for a single sumti, as in Examples 8.1 through 8.3, then a sumti modal connection may be employed:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d4>8.4)	mi jgari ri'agi le kabri gi lei djacu
	I grasp because the cup, the-mass-of water.
</pre><a href=#e8d4>Example 8.4 </a>means exactly the same as <a href=#e8d{1}>Examples 8.1 </a>through <a href=#e8d3>8.3</a>, but there is no idiomatic English translation that will distinguish it from them.
<p>
<cx "modal termset connection">  XE "modals: termset connection"   <cx "termset modal connection">  XE "termset modal connection"   If the two connected bridi are different in more than one sumti, then a termset may be employed. Termsets are explained more fully in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>, but are essentially a mechanism for creating connections between multiple sumti simultaneously.
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d5>8.5)	mi dunda le cukta la djan.  .imu'ibo la djan. dunda lei jdini mi
	I gave the book to John.  Motivated-by John gave the-mass-of money to-me.
	I gave the book to John, because John gave money to me.
</pre>means the same as:
<p>
<lx "nu'i">  XE "nu'i"   <lx "nu'u">  XE "nu'u"   <pre><a name=e8d6>8.6)	nu'i mu'igi mi le cukta la djan. gi la djan. lei jdini mi nu'u dunda
	[start] because I, the book, John; John, the-mass-of money, me [end] gives.
</pre><p>Here there are three sumti in each half of the termset, because the two bridi share only their selbri.
<p>
<cx "modal connection of selbri, using bridi-tail modal connection">  XE "modal connection of selbri: using bridi-tail modal connection"   <cx "modal bridi-tail connection">  XE "modal bridi-tail connection"   <cx "bridi-tail modal connection">  XE "bridi-tail modal connection"   There is no modal connection between selbri as such: bridi which differ only in the selbri can be modally connected using bridi-tail modal connection. The bridi-tail construct is more fully explained in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>, but essentially it consists of a selbri with optional sumti following it. <a href=#e7d3>Example 7.3 </a>is suitable for bridi-tail connection, and could be shortened to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d7>8.7)	mi mu'igi viska le cukta gi lebna le cukta
	I, because saw the book, took the book.
</pre><p>Again, no straightforward English translation exists. It is even possible to shorten <a href=#e8d7>Example 8.7 </a>further to:
<p>
<lx "vau">  XE "vau"   <pre><a name=e8d8>8.8)	mi mu'igi viska gi lebna vau le cukta
	I because saw, therefore took, the book.
</pre>where “le cukta” is set off by the non-elidable “vau” and is made to belong to both bridi-tails — see <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14 </a>for more explanations.
<p>
<cx "vau for shared bridi-tail sumti, avoiding">  XE "vau for shared bridi-tail sumti: avoiding"   <cx "shared bridi-tail sumti, avoiding">  XE "shared bridi-tail sumti: avoiding"   Since this is a chapter on rearranging sumti, it is worth pointing out that <a href=#e8d8>Example 8.8 </a>can be further rearranged to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d9>8.9)	mi le cukta mu'igi viska gi lebna
	I, the book, because saw, therefore took
</pre>which doesn't require the extra “vau”; all sumti before a conjunction of bridi-tails are shared.

<p>
<pre><a name=e9d6>9.6)	mi se bapli tavla bau la lojban.

	ne	GOI	incidental relative phrase
	mau	BAI	zmadu modal
	me'a	BAI	mleca modal
</pre><p>Relative phrases and clauses are explained in much more detail in <a href=chap8.html>Chapter 8</a>. However, there is a construction which combines a modal with a relative phrase which is relevant to this chapter. Consider the following examples of relative clauses:
<p>

</pre><lx "poi">  XE "poi"   In <a href=#e10d1>Example 10.1</a>, “la .apasionatas.” refers to a particular performance of the sonata, namely the one performed by Rubenstein. Therefore, the relative clause “poi se cusku” uses the cmavo “poi” (of selma'o NOI) to restrict the meaning of “la .apasionatas” to the performance in question.
<p>
<lx "noi">  XE "noi"   In <a href=#e10d2>Example 10.2</a>, however, “la .apasionatas.” refers to the sonata as a whole, and the information that it was composed by Beethoven is merely incidental. The cmavo “noi” (also of selma'o NOI) expresses the incidental nature of this relationship.
<p>
<lx "pe">  XE "pe"   <lx "ne">  XE "ne"   The cmavo “pe” and “ne” (of selma'o GOI) are roughly equivalent to “poi” and “noi” respectively, but are followed by sumti rather than full bridi. We can abbreviate <a href=#e10d1>Example 10.1 </a>and <a href=#e10d2>Example 10.2 </a>to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d3>10.3)	la .apasionatas pe la .artr. rubnstain. se nelci mi
	The Appassionata of Artur Rubenstein is-liked-by me.

</pre><cx "relative phrases, contrasted with relative clauses in preciseness">  XE “relative phrase: contrasted with relative clause in preciseness"   Here the precise selbri of the relative clauses is lost: all we can tell is that the Appassionata is connected in some way with Rubenstein (in <a href=#e10d3>Example 10.3</a>) and Beethoven (in <a href=#e10d4>Example 10.4</a>), and that the relationships are respectively restrictive and incidental.

The place structures are:
<p>

</pre><a href=#e10d7>Example 10.7 </a>requires that Frank likes Betty, but adds the information that his liking for Betty exceeds his liking for Mary. The modal appears in the form “semau” because the x2 place of “zmadu” is the basis for comparison: in this case, Frank's liking for Mary.
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d8>10.8)	la frank. nelci la meiris. ne seme'a la betis.

It would be possible to rephrase <a href=#e10d7>Example 10.7 </a>using “me'a” rather than “semau”, and <a href=#e10d8>Example 10.8 </a>using “mau” rather than “seme'a”, but such usage would be unnecessarily confusing.

<p>
<pre><a name=e10d9>10.9)	la frank. nelci la meiris. seme'a la betis.
	Frank likes Mary is-less-than Betty.
	Frank's liking Mary is less than Betty.

<pre><a name=e10d10>10.10)	le ni la frank. nelci la betis. cu zmadu

Some other modals that are often associated with relative phrases are: “seba'i” (“instead of”), “ci'u” (“on scale”), “de'i” (“dated”), “du'i” (“as much as”). Some BAI tags can be used equally well in relative phrases or attached to bridi; others seem useful only attached to bridi.

<a name=s11><h3>Mixed modal connection</h3>
<p>
It is possible to mix logical connection (explained in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>) with modal connection, in a way that simultaneously asserts the logical connection and the modal relationship. Consider the sentences:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d1>11.1)	mi nelci do .ije mi nelci la djein.
	I like you.  And I like Jane
</pre>which is a logical connection, and
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d2>11.2)	mi nelci do  .iki'ubo mi nelci la djein.
	I like you.  Justified-by I like Jane.
</pre><cx "connection, simultaneously modal and logical">  XE "connection: simultaneously modal and logical"   <cx "modal connection, simultaneous with logical">  XE "modal connection: simultaneous with logical"   <cx "mixed modal connection, of sentences">  XE "mixed modal connection: of sentences"   The meanings of <a href=#e11d1>Example 11.1 </a>and <a href=#e11d2>Example 11.2 </a>can be simultaneously expressed by combining the two compound cmavo, thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d3>11.3)	mi nelci do  .ijeki'ubo mi nelci la djein.
	I like you.  And justified-by I like Jane.
</pre><cx "mixed modal connection, definition">  XE "mixed modal connection: definition"   Here the two sentences “mi nelci do” and “mi nelci la djein.” are simultaneously asserted, their logical connection is asserted, and their causal relationship is asserted. The logical connective “je” comes before the modal “ki'u” in all such mixed connections.
<p>
Since “mi nelci do” and “mi nelci la djein.” differ only in the final sumti, we can transform <a href=#e11d3>Example 11.3 </a>into a mixed sumti connection:
<p>
<cx "mixed modal connection, of sumti">  XE "mixed modal connection: of sumti"   <pre><a name=e11d4>11.4)	mi nelci do .eki'ubo la djein.

Mixed connectives are always afterthought; forethought connectives must be either logical or modal.
<p>
<cx "mixed modal connection, of bridi-tails">  XE "mixed modal connection: of bridi-tails"   There are numerous other afterthought logical and non-logical connectives that can have modal information planted within them. For example, a bridi-tail connected version of <a href=#e11d4>Example 11.4 </a>would be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d5>11.5)	mi nelci do gi'eki'ubo nelci la djein.

It would also be possible to change the “.ijeseri'abo” to “.ije seri'a”, which would show that the “tu'e <dots>…</dots>tu'u” portion was an effect, but would not pin down the “mi bevri le dakli” portion as the cause. It is legal for a modal (or a tense; see <a href=chap10.html>Chapter 10</a>) to modify the whole of a “tu'e <dots>…</dots>tu'u” construct.

<a name=s12><h3>Modal conversion: JAI</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>

</pre><cx "conversion, swapping with modal place">  XE "conversion: swapping with modal place"   <lx "SE">  XE "SE selma’o"   <lx "BAI">  XE "BAI selma’o"   So far, conversion of numbered bridi places with SE and the addition of modal places with BAI have been two entirely separate operations. However, it is possible to convert a selbri in such a way that, rather than exchanging two numbered places, a modal place is made into a numbered place. For example,
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d1>12.1)	mi cusku bau la lojban.
	I express [something] in-language Lojban.
</pre><lx "jai">  XE "jai"   <lx "JAI">  XE "JAI selma’o"   <cx "modal conversion, grammar of">  XE "modal conversion: grammar of"   <cx "modal conversion, place structure of">  XE "modal conversion: place structure of"   <cx "conversion, modal">  XE "conversion: modal"   <cx "place structure, effect of modal conversion on">  XE "place structure: effect of modal conversion on"   <lx "fai">  XE "fai"   <lx "FA">  XE "FA selma’o"   has an explicit x1 place occupied by “mi” and an explicit “bau” place occupied by “la lojban.” To exchange these two, we use a modal conversion operator consisting of “jai” (of selma'o JAI) followed by the modal cmavo. Thus, the modal conversion of <a href=#e12d1>Example 12.1 </a>is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d2>12.2)	la lojban. jai bau cusku fai mi
	Lojban is-the-language-of-expression used-by me.
</pre><cx "modal conversion, access to original first place with fai">  XE "modal conversion: access to original first place with fai"   <cx "fai, as allowing access to original first place in modal conversion">  XE "fai: as allowing access to original first place in modal conversion"   In <a href=#e12d2>Example 12.2</a>, the modal place “la lojban.” has become the x1 place of the new selbri “jai bau cusku”. What has happened to the old x1 place? There is no numbered place for it to move to, so it moves to a special “unnumbered place” marked by the tag “fai” of selma'o FA.
<p>
<cx "fai, effect on numbering of place structure places">  XE "fai: effect on numbering of place structure places"   Note: For the purposes of place numbering, “fai” behaves like “fi'a”; it does not affect the numbering of the other places around it.
<p>
<cx "modal conversions, in descriptions">  XE "modal conversions: in descriptions"   Like SE conversions, JAI conversions are especially convenient in descriptions. We may refer to “the language of an expression” as “le jai bau cusku”, for example.
<p>
<cx "jai without modal, meaning">  XE "jai without modal: meaning"   <cx "modal conversion, with no modal specified">  XE "modal conversion: with no modal specified"   In addition, it is grammatical to use “jai” without a following modal. This usage is not related to modals, but is explained here for completeness. The effect of “jai” by itself is to send the x1 place, which should be an abstraction, into the “fai” position, and to raise one of the sumti from the abstract sub-bridi into the x1 place of the main bridi. This feature is discussed in more detail in <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11</a>. The following two examples mean the same thing:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d3>12.3)	le nu mi lebna le cukta cu se krinu le nu mi viska le cukta
	The event-of (I take the book) is-justified-by the event-of (I see the book).

There are two forms of negation in Lojban: contradictory and scalar negation. Contradictory negation expresses what is false, whereas scalar negation says that some alternative to what has been stated is true. A simple example is the difference between “John didn't go to Paris” (contradictory negation) and “John went to (somewhere) other than Paris” (scalar negation).

A common use of modals with “-nai” is to deny a causal relationship:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d1>13.1)	mi nelci do mu'inai le nu do nelci mi

<cx "negation of fi'o modals, by negating selbri">  XE "negation of fi'o modals: by negating selbri"   <cx "fi'o modals, negation of by negating selbri">  XE "fi'o modals: negation of by negating selbri"   Note: Modals made with “fi'o” plus a selbri cannot be negated directly. The selbri can itself be negated either with contradictory or with scalar negation, however.

<a name=s14><h3>Sticky modals</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre>	ki	KI	stickiness flag
</pre><cx "sticky modals, definition">  XE "sticky modals: definition"   <cx "modals, making long-scope">  XE "modals: making long-scope"   <lx "ki">  XE "ki"   <cx "modals, making sticky">  XE "modals: making sticky"   Like tenses, modals can be made persistent from the bridi in which they appear to all following bridi. The effect of this “stickiness” is to make the modal, along with its following sumti, act as if it appeared in every successive bridi. Stickiness is put into effect by following the modal (but not any following sumti) with the cmavo “ki” of selma'o KI. For example,
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d1>14.1)	mi tavla bau la lojban. bai ki tu'a la frank.
		.ibabo mi tavla bau la gliban.
	I speak in-language Lojban compelled-by some-property-of Frank.
		Afterward, I speak in-language English.
</pre>means the same as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d2>14.2)	mi tavla bau la lojban. bai tu'a la frank.
		.ibabo mi tavla bau la gliban. 
bai tu'a la frank.
	I speak in-language Lojban compelled-by some-property-of Frank.
		Afterward, I speak in-language English
compelled-by some-property-of Frank.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e14d1>Example 14.1</a>, “bai” is made sticky, and so Frank's compelling is made applicable to every following bridi. “bau” is not sticky, and so the language may vary from bridi to bridi, and if not specified in a particular bridi, no assumption can safely be made about its value.
<p>
<cx "sticky modal, canceling">  XE "sticky modals: canceling"   To cancel stickiness, use the form “BAI ki ku”, which stops any modal value for the specified BAI from being passed to the next bridi. To cancel stickiness for all modals simultaneously, and also for any sticky tenses that exist (“ki” is used for both modals and tenses), use “ki” by itself, either before the selbri or (in the form “ki ku”) anywhere in the bridi:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d3>14.3)	mi ki tavla
	I speak (no implication about language or compulsion).
</pre><cx "sticky modals, fi'o proscribed from">  XE "sticky modals: fi'o proscribed from"   <cx "fi'o, proscribed for sticky modals">  XE "fi'o: proscribed for sticky modals"   Note: Modals made with “fi'o”-plus-selbri cannot be made sticky. This is an unfortunate, but unavoidable, restriction.
<p>
<a name=s15><h3>Logical and non-logical connection of modals</h3>
<p>
<cx "logical connection, of modals">  XE "logical connection: of modals"   <cx "non-logical connection, of modals">  XE "non-logical connection: of modals"   Logical and non-logical connectives are explained in detail in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>. For the purposes of this chapter, it suffices to point out that a logical (or non-logical) connection between two bridi which differ only in a modal can be reduced to a single bridi with a connective between the modals. As a result, <a href=#e15d1>Example 15.1 </a>and <a href=#e15d2>Example 15.2 </a>mean the same thing:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d1>15.1)	la frank. bajra seka'a le zdani  .ije la frank. bajra 
teka'a le zdani
	Frank runs with-destination the house.  And Frank runs 
with-origin the house.
	Frank runs to the house, and Frank runs from the house.
</pre><lx "je">  XE "je"   <pre><a name=e15d2>15.2)	la frank. bajra seka'a je teka'a le zdani
	Frank runs with-destination and with-origin the house.
	Frank runs to and from the house.
</pre><lx "ce'e">  XE "ce'e"   Neither example implies whether a single act, or two acts, of running is referred to. To compel the sentence to refer to a single act of running, you can use the form:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d3>15.3)	la frank. bajra seka'a le zdani ce'e teka'a le zdani
	Frank runs with-destination the house [joined-to] with-origin the-house.
</pre><p>The cmavo “ce'e” creates a termset containing two terms (termsets are explained in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14 </a>and <a href=chap16.html>Chapter 16</a>). When a termset contains more than one modal tag derived from a single BAI, the convention is that the two tags are derived from a common event.
<p>
<a name=s16><h3>CV'V cmavo of selma'o BAI with irregular forms</h3>
<p>
<cx "modal cmavo, regular form for derivation">  XE "modal cmavo: regular form for derivation"   There are 65 cmavo of selma'o BAI, of which all but one (“do'e”, discussed in <a href=#s6>Section 6</a>), are derived directly from selected gismu. Of these 64 cmavo, 36 are entirely regular and have the form CV'V, where C is the first consonant of the corresponding gismu, and the Vs are the two vowels of the gismu. The remaining BAI cmavo, which are irregular in one way or another, are listed in the table below. The table is divided into sub-tables according to the nature of the exception; some cmavo appear in more than one sub-table, and are so noted.

<cx "modal cmavo, table with English equivalents">  XE "modal cmavo: table with English equivalents"   <cx "modal cmavo table, format of">  XE "modal cmavo table: format of"   The following table shows all the cmavo belonging to selma'o BAI, and has five columns. The first column is the cmavo itself; the second column is the gismu linked to it. The third column gives an English phrase which indicates the meaning of the cmavo; and the fourth column indicates its meaning when preceded by “se”.
<p>
For those cmavo with meaningful “te”, “ve”, and even “xe” conversions (depending on the number of places of the underlying gismu), the meanings of these are shown on one or two extra rows following the primary row for that cmavo.
<p>
<cx "modal cmavo, basis in gismu place structure">  XE "modal cmavo: basis in gismu place structure"   It should be emphasized that the place structures of the gismu control the meanings of the BAI cmavo.

<br>
Imaginary Journeys: The Lojban Space/Time Tense System</h2>
<h6>$Revision: 4.0 $<br>
mkhtml: 1.1</h6></p></center>
<p>
<a name=s1><h3>Introductory</h3>
<p>
<cx "tense, explanation of presentation method">  XE "tense: explanation of presentation method"   This chapter attempts to document and explain the space/time tense system of Lojban. It does not attempt to answer all questions of the form “How do I say such-and-such (an English tense) in Lojban?” Instead, it explores the Lojban tense system from the inside, attempting to educate the reader into a Lojbanic viewpoint. Once the overall system is understood and the resources that it makes available are familiar, the reader should have some hope of using appropriate tense constructs and being correctly understood.
<p>
<cx "tense, Lojban contrasted with native languages">  XE "tense: Lojban contrasted with native languages"   The system of Lojban tenses presented here may seem really complex because of all the pieces and all the options; indeed, this chapter is the longest one in this book. But tense is in fact complex in every language. In your native language, the subtleties of tense are intuitive. In foreign languages, you are seldom taught the entire system until you have reached an advanced level. Lojban tenses are extremely systematic and productive, allowing you to express subtleties based on what they mean rather than on how they act similarly to English tenses. This chapter concentrates on presenting an intuitive approach to the meaning of Lojban tense words and how they may be creatively and productively combined.
<p>
<cx "temporal tense, historical definition">  XE "temporal tense: historical definition"   <cx "temporal tense, real relationship to time in English">  XE "temporal tense: real relationship to time in English"   <cx "temporal tense, as mandatory in English">  XE "temporal tense: as mandatory in English"   <cx "temporal tense, Lojban contrasted with English in necessity">  XE "temporal tense: Lojban contrasted with English in necessity"   What is “tense”? Historically, “tense” is the attribute of verbs in English and related languages that expresses the time of the action. In English, three tenses are traditionally recognized, conventionally called the past, the present, and the future. There are also a variety of compound tenses used in English. However, there is no simple relationship between the form of an English tense and the time actually expressed:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>	<dd>I go to London tomorrow.
	I will go to London tomorrow.
	I am going to London tomorrow.
</dl>all mean the same thing, even though the first sentence uses the present tense; the second, the future tense; and the third, a compound tense usually called “present progressive”. Likewise, a newspaper headline says “JONES DIES”, although it is obvious that the time referred to must be in the past. Tense is a mandatory category of English: every sentence must be marked for tense, even if in a way contrary to logic, because every main verb has a tense marker built into to it. By contrast, Lojban brivla have no implicit tense marker attached to them.
<p>
<cx "tense, selbri types applicable to">  XE "tense: selbri types applicable to"   <cx "tense system, and space location">  XE "tense system: and space location"   <cx "tense system, and space location">  XE "tense system: and space location"   <cx "time, as part of tense system (see also tense, temporal tense)">  XE "time: as part of tense system (see also tense, temporal tense)"   <cx "space location, as part of tense system (see also tense, spatial tense)">  XE "space location: as part of tense system (see also tense, spatial tense)"   <cx "elided tense, meaning of">  XE "elided tense: meaning of"   In Lojban, the concept of tense extends to every selbri, not merely the verb-like ones. In addition, tense structures provide information about location in space as well as in time. All tense information is optional in Lojban: a sentence like:
<p>
<ex "go to market">  XE "go to market: example“  <pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	mi klama le zarci
	I go-to the market.
</pre>can be understood as:

<p>
<dl compact><dt>	<dd>I went to the market.
	I am going to the market.
	I have gone to the market.
	I will go to the market.
	I continually go to the market.
</dl>as well as many other possibilities: context resolves which is correct.

It goes immediately after the “cu”, and can in fact always replace the “cu” (although in very complex sentences the rules for eliding terminators may be changed as a result). In the following examples, “pu” is the tense marker for “past time”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d2>1.2)	mi cu pu klama le zarci
	mi pu klama le zarci
	I in-the-past go-to the market.
	I went to the market.

This “ku” is an elidable terminator, but it's almost never possible to actually elide it except at the end of the bridi:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d3>1.3)	puku mi klama le zarci
	In-the-past I go-to the market.
	Earlier, I went to the market.
<a name=e1d4>1.4)	mi klama puku le zarci
	I go-to in-the-past the market.
	I went earlier to the market.
<a name=e1d5>1.5)	mi klama le zarci pu [ku]
	I go-to the market in-the-past.
	I went to the market earlier.

Abnormal order, such as <a href=#e1d{3}>Examples 1.3 </a>through <a href=#e1d5>1.5 </a>exhibit, adds emphasis to the words that have been moved; in this case, the tense cmavo “pu”. Words at either end of the sentence tend to be more noticeable.

<a name=s2><h3>Spatial tenses: FAhA and VA</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	vi	VA	short distance
	va	VA	medium distance
	vu	VA	long distance
	zu'a	FAhA	left
	ri'u	FAhA	right
	ga'u	FAhA	up
	ni'a	FAhA	down
	ca'u	FAhA	front
	ne'i	FAhA	within
	be'a	FAhA	north of
</pre>(The complete list of FAhA cmavo can be found in <a href=#s28>Section 28</a>.)
<p>
Why is this section about spatial tenses rather than the more familiar time tenses of <a href=#s1>Section 1</a>, asks the reader? Because the model to be used in explaining both will be easier to grasp for space than for time. The explanation of time tenses will resume in <a href=#s4>Section 4</a>.
<p>
<cx "spatial tense, as optional in English">  XE "spatial tense: as optional in English"   <cx "spatial tense, compared with temporal tense in elidability">  XE "spatial tense: compared with temporal tense in elidability"   <cx "temporal tense, compared with spatial tense in elidability">  XE "temporal tense: compared with spatial tense in elidability"   <cx "temporal tense elision, compared with spatial tense elision in meaning">  XE "temporal tense elision: compared with spatial tense elision in meaning"   English doesn't have mandatory spatial tenses. Although there are plenty of ways in English of showing where an event happens, there is absolutely no need to do so. Considering this fact may give the reader a feel for what the optional Lojban time tenses are like. From the Lojban point of view, space and time are interchangeable, although they are not treated identically.

<cx "spatial tense, definition">  XE "spatial tense: definition"   <cx "imaginary journey, and spatial tense">  XE "imaginary journey: and spatial tense"   <cx "spatial tense, as an imaginary journey">  XE "spatial tense: as an imaginary journey"   <cx "VA, and distance">  XE "VA selma’o: and distance"   <cx "distance, specification with VA">  XE "distance: specification with VA"   <lx "FAhA">  XE "FAhA selma’o"   <lx "VA">  XE "VA selma’o"   <cx "spatial tense, distance">  XE "spatial tense: distance"   Lojban specifies the spatial tense of a bridi (the place at which it occurs) by using words from selma'o FAhA and VA to describe an imaginary journey from the speaker to the place referred to. FAhA cmavo specify the direction taken in the journey, whereas VA cmavo specify the distance gone. For example:
<p>
<cx "man biting dog">  XE "man biting dog"   <pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	le nanmu va batci le gerku
	The man [medium distance] bites the dog.
	Over there the man is biting the dog.
</pre><cx "imaginary journey, starting point">  XE "imaginary journey: starting point"   <cx "imaginary journey, ending point">  XE "imaginary journey: ending point"   <cx "spatial tense, referent of">  XE "spatial tense: referent of"   <cx "spatial tense, reference frame">  XE "spatial tense: reference frame"   <lx "va">  XE "va"   What is at a medium distance? The event referred to by the bridi: the man biting the dog. What is this event at a medium distance from? The speaker's location. We can understand the “va” as saying: “If you want to get from the speaker's location to the location of the bridi, journey for a medium distance (in some direction unspecified).” This “imaginary journey” can be used to understand not only <a href=#e2d1>Example 2.1</a>, but also every other spatial tense construct.
<p>
<cx "spatial tense, direction">  XE "spatial tense: direction"   <cx "FAhA, and direction">  XE "FAhA selma’o: and direction"   <cx "direction, specification with FAhA">  XE "direction: specification with FAhA"   Suppose you specify a direction with a FAhA cmavo, rather than a distance with a VA cmavo:
<p>
<lx "zu'a">  XE "zu'a"   <pre><a name=e2d2>2.2)	le nanmu zu'a batci le gerku
	The man [left] bites the dog.
</pre><p>Here the imaginary journey is again from the speaker's location to the location of the bridi, but it is now performed by going to the left (in the speaker's reference frame) for an unspecified distance. So a reasonable translation is:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>	<dd>To my left, the man bites the dog.
</dl><p>The “my” does not have an explicit equivalent in the Lojban, because the speaker's location is understood as the starting point.
<p>
<cx "zu'a, derivation of word">  XE "zu'a: derivation of word"   <cx "VA, relation of words to ti, ta, tu">  XE "VA selma’o: relation of words to ti, ta, tu"   <lx "zu'a">  XE "zu'a"   <lx "VA">  XE "VA selma’o"   <lx "vi">  XE "vi"   <lx "va">  XE "va"   <lx "vu">  XE "vu"   (Etymologically, by the way, “zu'a” is derived from “zunle”, the gismu for “left”, whereas “vi”, “va”, and “vu” are intended to be reminiscent of “ti”, “ta”, and “tu”, the demonstrative pronouns “this-here”, “that-there”, and “that-yonder”.)
<p>
<cx "tense, order of direction specification in">  XE "tense: order of direction specification in"   <cx "tense, order of distance specification in">  XE "tense: order of distance specification in"   <cx "spatial tenses, order of direction and distance specifications">  XE "spatial tense: order of direction and distance specification"   <cx "direction, order of relative to distance in spatial tenses">  XE "direction: order of relative to distance in spatial tenses"   <cx "distance, order of relative to direction in spatial tenses">  XE "distance: order of relative to direction in spatial tenses"   What about specifying both a direction and a distance? The rule here is that the direction must come before the distance:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d3>2.3)	le nanmu zu'avi batci le gerku
	The man [left] [short distance] bites the dog.
	Slightly to my left, the man bites the dog.
</pre><p>As explained in <a href=#s1>Section 1</a>, it would be perfectly correct to use “ku” to move this tense to the beginning or the end of the sentence to emphasize it:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d4>2.4)	zu'aviku le nanmu cu batci le gerku
	[Left] [short distance] the man bites the dog.
	Slightly to my left, the man bites the dog.
</pre><a name=s3><h3>Compound spatial tenses</h3>
<p>
<cx "compound tense, definition">  XE "compound tense: definition"   Humph, says the reader: this talk of “imaginary journeys” is all very well, but what's the point of it? — “zu'a” means “on the left” and “vi” means “nearby”, and there's no more to be said. The imaginary-journey model becomes more useful when so-called compound tenses are involved. A compound tense is exactly like a simple tense, but has several FAhAs run together:
<p>

A translation might read:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>	<dd>Left of a place above me, the man bites the dog.
</dl>(Perhaps the speaker is at the bottom of a manhole, and the dog-biting is going on at the edge of the street.)

<cx "compound tense, Lojban contrasted with English in order of specification">  XE "compound tense: Lojban contrasted with English in order of specification"   <cx "compound tense ordering, Lojban contrasted with English">  XE "compound tense ordering: Lojban contrasted with English"   In the English translation, the keywords “left” and “above” occur in reverse order to the Lojban order. This effect is typical of what happens when we “unfold” Lojban compound tenses into their English equivalents, and shows why it is not very useful to try to memorize a list of Lojban tense constructs and their colloquial English equivalents.
<p>
The opposite order also makes sense:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d2>3.2)	le nanmu zu'a ga'u batci le gerku
	The man [left] [up] bites the dog.
	Above a place to the left of me, the man bites the dog.
</pre><cx "compound spatial tense, effect of different ordering">  XE "compound spatial tense: effect of different ordering"   In ordinary space, the result of going up and then to the left is the same as that of going left and then up, but such a simple relationship does not apply in all environments or to all directions: going south, then east, then north may return one to the starting point, if that point is the North Pole.
<p>
<cx "compound spatial tense, with direction and distance">  XE "compound spatial tense: with direction and distance"   Each direction can have a distance following:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d3>3.3)	le nanmu zu'avi ga'uvu batci le gerku
	The man [left] [short distance] [up] [long distance] bites the dog.
	Far above a place slightly to the left of me, the man bites the dog.
</pre><cx "compound spatial tense, beginning with distance only">  XE "compound spatial tense: beginning with distance only"   A distance can also come at the beginning of the tense construct, without any specified direction. (<a href=#e2d1>Example 2.1</a>, with VA alone, is really a special case of this rule when no directions at all follow.)
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d4>3.4)	le nanmu vi zu'a batci le gerku

	Within a place a long distance to the right of a place which is a medium
distance downward from a place a short distance in front of me, 
the man bites the dog.
</pre><p>Whew! It's a good thing tense constructs are optional: having to say all that could certainly be painful. Note, however, how much shorter the Lojban version of <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5 </a>is than the English version.

<a name=s4><h3>Temporal tenses: PU and ZI</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	pu	PU	past
	ca	PU	present
	ba	PU	future
	zi	ZI	short time distance
	za	ZI	medium time distance
	zu	ZI	long time distance

(If space could be expressed before or after time, then certain constructions would be ambiguous.)
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d1>4.1)	le nanmu pu batci le gerku
	The man [past] bites the dog.
	The man bit the dog.
</pre>means that to reach the dog-biting, you must take an imaginary journey through time, moving towards the past an unspecified distance. (Of course, this journey is even more imaginary than the ones talked about in the previous sections, since time-travel is not an available option.)
<p>
<lx "pu">  XE "pu"   <lx "ca">  XE "ca"   <lx "ba">  XE "ba"   <cx "time, contrasted with space in number of directions">  XE "time: contrasted with space in number of directions"   <cx "space, contrasted with time in number of directions">  XE "space: contrasted with time in number of directions"   Lojban recognizes three temporal directions: “pu” for the past, “ca” for the present, and “ba” for the future. (Etymologically, these derive from the corresponding gismu “purci”, “cabna”, and “balvi”. See <a href=#s23>Section 23 </a>for an explanation of the exact relationship between the cmavo and the gismu.) There are many more spatial directions, since there are FAhA cmavo for both absolute and relative directions as well as “direction-like relationships” like “surrounding”, “within”, “touching”, etc. (See <a href=#s28>Section 28 </a>for a complete list.) But there are really only two directions in time: forward and backward, toward the future and toward the past. Why, then, are there three cmavo of selma'o PU?
<p>
<cx "ca, rational for">  XE "ca: rational for"   <cx "ca, compared with bu'u">  XE "ca: compared with bu'u"   <cx "bu'u, compared with ca">  XE "bu'u: compared with ca"   <cx "tense, as subjective perception">  XE "tense: as subjective perception"   <lx "ca">  XE "ca"   <lx "bu'u">  XE "bu'u"   The reason is that tense is subjective: human beings perceive space and time in a way that does not necessarily agree with objective measurements. We have a sense of “now” which includes part of the objective past and part of the objective future, and so we naturally segment the time line into three parts. The Lojban design recognizes this human reality by providing a separate time-direction cmavo for the “zero direction”, Similarly, there is a FAhA cmavo for the zero space direction: “bu'u”, which means something like “coinciding”.

The nature of tense is not only subjective but also observer-based.)
<p>
Here are some examples of temporal tenses:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d2>4.2)	le nanmu puzi batci le gerku
	The man [past] [short distance] bites the dog.
	A short time ago, the man bit the dog.
<a name=e4d3>4.3)	le nanmu pu pu batci le gerku
	The man [past] [past] bites the dog.
	Earlier than an earlier time than now, the man bit the dog.
	The man had bitten the dog.
	The man had been biting the dog.
<a name=e4d4>4.4)	le nanmu ba puzi batci le gerku
	The man [future] [past] [short] bites the dog.
	Shortly earlier than some time later than now, the man will bite the dog.
	Soon before then, the man will have bitten the dog.
	The man will have just bitten the dog.
	The man will just have been biting the dog.
</pre><cx "compound temporal tense, beginning with distance only">  XE "compound temporal tense: beginning with distance only"   What about the analogue of an initial VA without a direction? Lojban does allow an initial ZI with or without following PUs:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d5>4.5)	le nanmu zi pu batci le gerku
	The man [short] [past] bites the dog.
	Before a short time from or before now, the man bit or will bite the dog.
<a name=e4d6>4.6)	le nanmu zu batci le gerku
	The man [long] bites the dog.
	A long time from or before now, the man will bite or bit the dog.
</pre><cx "unspecified direction, temporal contrasted with in spatial">  XE "unspecified direction: temporal contrasted with in spatial"   <a href=#e4d5>Example 4.5 </a>and <a href=#e4d6>Example 4.6 </a>are perfectly legitimate, but may not be very much used: “zi” by itself signals an event that happens at a time close to the present, but without saying whether it is in the past or the future. A rough translation might be “about now, but not exactly now”.
<p>
<ex "nearby in time">  XE "nearby in time: example“  Because we can move in any direction in space, we are comfortable with the idea of events happening in an unspecified space direction (“nearby” or “far away”), but we live only from past to future, and the idea of an event which happens “nearby in time” is a peculiar one. Lojban provides lots of such possibilities that don't seem all that useful to English-speakers, even though you can put them together productively; this fact may be a limitation of English.
<p>
<cx "tense, with both temporal and spatial">  XE "tense: with both temporal and spatial"   Finally, here are examples which combine temporal and spatial tense:

But Lojbanic events may be much more “spread out” than that: “mi vasxu” (I breathe) is something which is true during the whole of my life from birth to death, and over the entire part of the earth where I spend my life. The cmavo of VEhA (for space) and ZEhA (for time) can be added to any of the tense constructs we have already studied to specify the size of the space or length of the time over which the bridi is claimed to be true.
<p>
<ex "child on ice">  XE "child on ice: example“  <pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	le verba ve'i cadzu le bisli
	The child [small space interval] walks-on the ice.
	In a small space, the child walks on the ice.
	The child walks about a small area of the ice.
</pre>means that her walking was done in a small area. Like the distances, the interval sizes are classified only roughly as “small, medium, large”, and are relative to the context: a small part of a room might be a large part of a table in that room.
<p>
Here is an example using a time interval:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d2>5.2)	le verba ze'a cadzu le bisli
	The child [medium time interval] walks-on the ice.
	For a medium time, the child walks/walked/will walk on the ice.

It is possible to specify both directions or distances and an interval, in which case the interval always comes afterward:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d3>5.3)	le verba pu ze'a cadzu le bisli
	The child [past] [medium time interval] walks-on the ice.

Does the interval start at the point, end at the point, or is it centered on the point? By adding an additional direction cmavo after the interval, this question can be conclusively answered:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d4>5.4)	mi ca ze'ica cusku dei
	I [present] [short time interval – present] express this-utterance.
	I am now saying this sentence.
</pre><cx "interval size, as context-dependent">  XE "interval size: as context-dependent"   means that for an interval starting a short time in the past and extending to a short time in the future, I am expressing the utterance which is <a href=#e5d4>Example 5.4</a>. Of course, “short” is relative, as always in tenses. Even a long sentence takes up only a short part of a whole day; in a geological context, the era of Homo sapiens would only be a “ze'i” interval.
<p>
By contrast,
<p>
<cx "pu, meaning when following interval specification">  XE "pu: meaning when following interval specification"   <pre><a name=e5d5>5.5)	mi ca ze'ipu cusku dei
	I [present] [short time interval – past] express this-utterance.
	I have just been saying this sentence.
</pre><cx "imaginary journey, with interval direction">  XE "imaginary journey: with interval direction"   means that for a short time interval extending from the past to the present I have been expressing <a href=#e5d5>Example 5.5</a>. Here the imaginary journey starts at the present, lays down one end point of the interval, moves into the past, and lays down the other endpoint. Another example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d6>5.6)	mi pu ze'aba citka le mi sanmi
	I [past] [medium time interval - future] eat my meal.
	For a medium time afterward, I ate my meal.
	I ate my meal for a while.
</pre><p>With “ca” instead of “ba”, <a href=#e5d6>Example 5.6 </a>becomes <a href=#e5d7>Example 5.7</a>,
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d7>5.7)	mi pu ze'aca citka le mi sanmi
	I [past] [medium time interval - present] eat my meal
	For a medium time before and afterward, I ate my meal.
	I ate my meal for a while.
</pre>because the interval would then be centered on the past moment rather than oriented toward the future of that moment. The colloquial English translations are the same — English is not well-suited to representing this distinction.
<p>
Here are some examples of the use of space intervals with and without specified directions:
<p>
<ex "fish on right">  XE "fish on right: example“  <pre><a name=e5d8>5.8)	ta ri'u ve'i finpe
	That-there [right] [short space interval] is-a-fish.
	That thing on my right is a fish.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e5d8>Example 5.8</a>, there is no equivalent in the colloquial English translation of the “small interval” which the fish occupies. Neither the Lojban nor the English expresses the orientation of the fish. Compare <a href=#e5d9>Example 5.9</a>:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d9>5.9)	ta ri'u ve'ica'u finpe
	That-there [right] [short space interval - front] is-a-fish.
	That thing on my right extending forwards is a fish.
</pre><p>Here the space interval occupied by the fish extends from a point on my right to another point in front of the first point.
<p>
<a name=s6><h3>Vague intervals and non-specific tenses</h3>
<p>
<cx "interval size, unspecified">  XE "interval size: unspecified"   <cx "interval size, vague">  XE "interval size: vague"   What is the significance of failing to specify an interval size of the type discussed in <a href=#s5>Section 5</a>? The Lojban rule is that if no interval size is given, the size of the space or time interval is left vague by the speaker. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d1>6.1)	mi pu klama le zarci
	I [past] go-to the market.
</pre>really means:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>	<dd>At a moment in the past, and possibly other moments as well, the event
	“I went to the market” was in progress.
</dl><cx "past event, possible extension into present">  XE "past event: possible extension into present"   <cx "tense direction, implications on scope of event">  XE "tense direction: implications on scope of event"   The vague or unspecified interval contains an instant in the speaker's past. However, there is no indication whether or not the whole interval is in the speaker's past! It is entirely possible that the interval during which the going-to-the-market is happening stretches into the speaker's present or even future.
<p>
<cx "tense, Lojban contrasted with English in implications of completeness">  XE "tense: Lojban contrasted with English in implications of completeness"   <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1 </a>points up a fundamental difference between Lojban tenses and English tenses. An English past-tense sentence like “I went to the market” generally signifies that the going-to-the-market is entirely in the past; that is, that the event is complete at the time of speaking. Lojban “pu” has no such implication.
<p>
<cx "Classical Greek aorist tense, compared with Lojban tense">  XE "Classical Greek aorist tense: compared with Lojban tense"   <cx "aorist, definition">  XE "aorist: definition"   <cx "tense, aorist">  XE "tense: aorist"   This property of a past tense is sometimes called “aorist”, in reference to a similar concept in the tense system of Classical Greek. All of the Lojban tenses have the same property, however:
<p>
<cx "future event, possible extension into present">  XE "future event: possible extension into present"   <pre><a name=e6d2>6.2)	le tricu ba crino
	The tree [future] is-green.
	The tree will be green.
</pre>does not imply (as the colloquial English translation does) that the tree is not green now. The vague interval throughout which the tree is, in fact, green may have already started.
<p>
This general principle does not mean that Lojban has no way of indicating that a tree will be green but is not yet green. Indeed, there are several ways of expressing that concept: see <a href=#s10>Section 10 </a>(event contours) and <a href=#s20>Section 20 </a>(logical connection between tenses).
<p>
<a name=s7><h3>Dimensionality: VIhA</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	vi'i	VIhA	on a line
	vi'a	VIhA	in an area
	vi'u	VIhA	through a volume
	vi'e	VIhA	throughout a space/time interval
</pre><cx "spatial tense, contrasted with temporal in dimensionality">  XE "spatial tense: contrasted with temporal in dimensionality"   <cx "spatial tense, linear">  XE "spatial tense: linear"   <cx "spatial tense, planar">  XE "spatial tense: planar"   <cx "spatial tense, one-dimensional">  XE "spatial tense: one-dimensional"   <cx "spatial tense, two-dimensional">  XE "spatial tense: two-dimensional"   <cx "spatial tense, three-dimensional">  XE "spatial tense: three-dimensional"   The cmavo of ZEhA are sufficient to express time intervals. One fundamental difference between space and time, however, is that space is multi-dimensional. Sometimes we want to say not only that something moves over a small interval, but also perhaps that it moves in a line. Lojban allows for this. I can specify that a motion “in a small space” is more specifically “in a short line”, “in a small area”, or “through a small volume”.
<p>
<lx "VIhA">  XE "VIhA selma’o"   What about the child walking on the ice in <a href=#e5d{1}>Examples 5.1 </a>through <a href=#e5d3>5.3</a>? Given the nature of ice, probably the area interpretation is most sensible. I can make this assumption explicit with the appropriate member of selma'o VIhA:
<p>
<lx "vi'a">  XE "vi'a"   <pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	le verba ve'a vi'a cadzu le bisli
	The child [medium space interval] [2-dimensional] walks-on the ice.
	In a medium-sized area, the child walks on the ice.
</pre><cx "spatial tense intervals, order of VEhA and VIhA in">  XE "spatial tense interval: order of VEhA and VIhA in"   <cx "spatial tense intervals, order of size and dimensionality in">  XE "spatial tense interval: order of size and dimensionality in"   <cx "dimensionality, order with size in spatial tense intervals">  XE "dimensionality: order with size in spatial tense intervals"   <cx "size, order with dimensionality in spatial tense intervals">  XE "size: order with dimensionality in spatial tense intervals"   Space intervals can contain either VEhA or VIhA or both, but if both, VEhA must come first, as <a href=#e7d1>Example 7.1 </a>shows.
<p>
<cx "dimensionality of interval, as subjective">  XE "dimensionality of interval: as subjective"   <cx "dimensionality, of walking">  XE "dimensionality: of walking"   The reader may wish to raise a philosophical point here. (Readers who don't wish to, should skip this paragraph.) The ice may be two-dimensional, or more accurately its surface may be, but since the child is three-dimensional, her walking must also be. The subjective nature of Lojban tense comes to the rescue here: the action is essentially planar, and the third dimension of height is simply irrelevant to walking. Even walking on a mountain could be called “vi'a”, because relatively speaking the mountain is associated with an essentially two-dimensional surface. Motion which is not confined to such a surface (e.g., flying, or walking through a three-dimensional network of tunnels, or climbing among mountains rather than on a single mountain) would be properly described with “vi'u”. So the cognitive, rather than the physical, dimensionality controls the choice of VIhA cmavo.
<p>
<cx "Einsteinian, space-time intervals with 4 dimensions">  XE "Einsteinian: space-time intervals with 4 dimensions"   <lx "vi'e">  XE "vi'e"   <cx "spatial tense, four-dimensional">  XE "spatial tense: four-dimensional"   <cx "tense, space-time dimension for intervals">  XE "tense: space-time dimension for intervals"   <cx "pastward, as a spatial tense">  XE "pastward: as a spatial tense"   <cx "futureward, as a spatial tense">  XE "futureward: as a spatial tense"   <cx "temporal tense, interaction with 4-dimensional spatial tense">  XE "temporal tense: interaction with 4-dimensional spatial tense"   <cx "spatial tense, 4-dimensional interaction with temporal tense">  XE "spatial tense: 4-dimensional interaction with temporal tense"   VIhA has a member “vi'e” which indicates a 4-dimensional interval, one that involves both space and time. This allows the spatial tenses to invade, to some degree, the temporal tenses; it is possible to make statements about space-time considered as an Einsteinian whole. (There are presently no cmavo of FAhA assigned to “pastward” and “futureward” considered as space rather than time directions — they could be added, though, if Lojbanists find space-time expression useful.) If a temporal tense cmavo is used in the same tense construct with a “vi'e” interval, the resulting tense may be self-contradictory.
<p>
<a name=s8><h3>Movement in space: MOhI</h3>

Suppose the truth of the bridi itself depends on the result of a movement, or represents an action being done while the speaker is moving? This too can be represented by the tense system, using the cmavo “mo'i” (of selma'o MOhI) plus a spatial direction and optional distance; the direction now refers to a direction of motion rather than a static direction from the speaker.

	The child walks toward her right on the ice.
</pre><a href=#e8d3>Example 8.3 </a>is analogous to <a href=#e8d1>Example 8.1</a>. The cmavo “ma'i” belongs to selma'o BAI (explained in <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>), and allows specifying a reference frame.

Whether a very short interval (a point) or a long interval of time is involved, the event may not be spread consistently throughout that interval. Lojban can use the cmavo of selma'o TAhE to express the idea of continuous or non-continuous actions.
<p>
<ex "attend school">  XE "attend school: example“  <pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	mi puzu ze'u velckule
	I [past] [long distance] [long interval] am-a-school-attendee (pupil).
	Long ago I attended school for a long time.
</pre>probably does not mean that I attended school continuously throughout the whole of that long-ago interval. Actually, I attended school every day, except for school holidays. More explicitly,
<p>
<ex "regularly">  XE "regularly: example“  <pre><a name=e9d2>9.2)	mi puzu ze'u di'i velckule
	I [past] [long distance] [long interval] [regularly] am-a-pupil.
	Long ago I regularly attended school for a long time.
</pre><lx "ru'i">  XE "ru'i"   <lx "di'i">  XE "di'i"   <lx "na'o">  XE "na'o"   <lx "ta'e">  XE "ta'e"   <cx "interval spread, mutually contrasted">  XE "interval spread: mutually contrasted"   The four TAhE cmavo are differentiated as follows: “ru'i” covers the entirety of the interval, “di'i” covers the parts of the interval which are systematically spaced subintervals; “na'o” covers part of the interval, but exactly which part is determined by context; “ta'e” covers part of the interval, selected with reference to the behavior of the actor (who often, but not always, appears in the x1 place of the bridi).
<p>
<cx "interval spread, with unspecified interval">  XE "interval spread: with unspecified interval"   Using TAhE does not require being so specific. Either the time direction or the time interval or both may be omitted (in which case they are vague). For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d3>9.3)	mi ba ta'e klama le zarci
	I [future] [habitually] go-to the market.
	I will habitually go to the market.
	I will make a habit of going to the market.
</pre>specifies the future, but the duration of the interval is indefinite. Similarly,
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d4>9.4)	mi na'o klama le zarci
	I [typically] go-to the market
	I typically go/went/will go to the market
</pre>illustrates an interval property in isolation. There are no distance or direction cmavo, so the point of time is vague; likewise, there is no interval cmavo, so the length of the interval during which these goings-to-the-market take place is also vague. As always, context will determine these vague values.
<p>
<ex "intermittently">  XE "intermittently: example“  <cx "interval spread, expressing “intermittently”">  XE "interval spread: expressing English intermittently"   <lx "nai">  XE "nai"   ““Intermittently” is the polar opposite notion to “continuously”, and is expressed not with its own cmavo, but by adding the negation suffix “-nai” (which belongs to selma'o NAI) to “ru'i”. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d5>9.5)	le verba ru'inai cadzu le bisli
	The child [continuously-not] walks-on the ice.
	The child intermittently walks on the ice.
</pre><cx "interval spread, negation with nai">  XE "interval spread: negation with nai"   As shown in the cmavo table above, all the cmavo of TAhE may be negated with “-nai”; “ru'inai” and “di'inai” are probably the most useful.

The cmavo “roi” (which belongs to selma'o ROI) can be appended to a number to make a quantified tense. Quantified tenses are common in English, but not so commonly named: they are exemplified by the adverbs “never”, “once”, “twice”, “thrice”, <dots>…</dots>“always”, and by the related phrases “many times”, “a few times”, “too many times”, and so on. All of these are handled in Lojban by a number plus “-roi”:

<p>
<pre><a name=e9d6>9.6)	mi paroi klama le zarci
	I [one time] go-to the market.
	I go to the market once.
<a name=e9d7>9.7)	mi du'eroi klama le zarci
	I [too-many times] go-to the market.
	I go to the market too often.
</pre><cx "temporal tense, quantified with direction">  XE "temporal tense: quantified with direction"   With the quantified tense alone, we don't know whether the past, the present, or the future is intended, but of course the quantified tense need not stand alone:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d8>9.8)	mi pu reroi klama le zarci
	I [past] [two times] go-to the market.
	I went to the market twice.
</pre><cx "quantified temporal tense with direction, Lojban contrasted with English in implications">  XE "quantified temporal tense with direction: Lojban contrasted with English in implications"   The English is slightly over-specific here: it entails that both goings-to- the-market were in the past, which may or may not be true in the Lojban sentence, since the implied interval is vague. Therefore, the interval may start in the past but extend into the present or even the future.
<p>
<cx "quantified temporal tense, negating with nai">  XE "quantified temporal tense: negating with nai"   Adding “-nai” to “roi” is also permitted, and has the meaning “other than (the number specified)”:
<p>
<ex "rat eats cheese">  XE "rat eats cheese: example“  <pre><a name=e9d9>9.9)	le ratcu reroinai citka le cirli
	The rat [twice-not] eats the cheese.
	The rat eats the cheese other than twice
</pre><p>This may mean that the rat eats the cheese fewer times, or more times, or not at all.
<p>
<ex "only once">  XE "only once: example“  <cx "quantified temporal tenses, caveat on implication of">  XE "quantified temporal tenses: caveat on implication of"   <cx "quantified temporal tenses, “once” contrasted with “only once”">  XE "quantified temporal tenses: \“once\” contrasted with \“only once\”"   <lx "ze'e">  XE "ze'e"   <cx "whole time interval, expressing">  XE "whole time interval: expressing"   It is necessary to be careful with sentences like <a href=#e9d6>Example 9.6 </a>and <a href=#e9d8>Example 9.8</a>, where a quantified tense appears without an interval. What <a href=#e9d8>Example 9.8 </a>really says is that during an interval of unspecified size, at least part of which was set in the past, the event of my going to the market happened twice. The example says nothing about what happened outside that vague time interval. This is often less than we mean. If we want to nail down that I went to the market once and only once, we can use the cmavo “ze'e” which represents the “whole time interval”: conceptually, an interval which stretches from time's beginning to its end:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d10>9.10)	mi ze'e paroi klama le zarci
	I [whole interval] [once] go-to the market.
</pre><p>Since specifying no ZEhA leaves the interval vague, <a href=#e9d8>Example 9.8 </a>might in appropriate context mean the same as <a href=#e9d10>Example 9.10 </a>after all — but <a href=#e9d10>Example 9.10 </a>allows us to be specific when specificity is necessary.
<p>
<lx "PU">  XE "PU selma’o"   <cx "temporal direction, exception in meaning when following ze'e">  XE "temporal direction: exception in meaning when following ze'e"   <cx "ze'e, effect on following PU direction">  XE "ze'e: effect on following PU direction"   <lx "ze'epu">  XE "ze'epu"   <lx "ze'eba">  XE "ze'eba"   <lx "ze'eca">  XE "ze'eca"   <ex "have never">  XE "have never: example“  <cx "ze'epu, meaning of">  XE "ze'epu: meaning of"   <cx "ze'eba, meaning of">  XE "ze'eba: meaning of"   <cx "ze'eca, meaning of">  XE "ze'eca: meaning of"   A PU cmavo following “ze'e” has a slightly different meaning from one that follows another ZEhA cmavo. The compound cmavo “ze'epu” signifies the interval stretching from the infinite past to the reference point (wherever the imaginary journey has taken you); “ze'eba” is the interval stretching from the reference point to the infinite future. The remaining form, “ze'eca”, makes specific the “whole of time” interpretation just given. These compound forms make it possible to assert that something has never happened without asserting that it never will.

<p>
<pre><a name=e9d11>9.11)	mi ze'epu noroi klama le zarci
	I [whole interval] [past] [never] go-to the market.

<cx "quantified space">  XE "quantified space"   <lx "ve'e">  XE "ve'e"   The space equivalent of “ze'e” is “ve'e”, and it can be used in the same way with a quantified space tense: see <a href=#s11>Section 11 </a>for an explanation of space interval modifiers.

</pre><cx "aspect, expressing">  XE "aspect: expressing"   <lx "ZAhO">  XE "ZAhO selma’o"   <cx "aspect, natural languages compared with respect to">  XE "aspect: natural languages compared with respect to"   The cmavo of selma'o ZAhO express the Lojban version of what is traditionally called “aspect”. This is not a notion well expressed by English tenses, but many languages (including Chinese and Russian among Lojban's six source languages) consider it more important than the specification of mere position in time.
<p>
<cx "event contours, definition">  XE "event contours: definition"   <cx "events, considered as a process">  XE "events: considered as a process"   <cx "event contours, syntax of">  XE "event contours: syntax of"   <cx "event contours, order with respect to TAhE and ROI">  XE "event contours: order with respect to TAhE and ROI"   The “event contours” of selma'o ZAhO, with their bizarre keywords, represent the natural portions of an event considered as a process, an occurrence with an internal structure including a beginning, a middle, and an end. Since the keywords are scarcely self-explanatory, each ZAhO will be explained in detail here. Note that from the viewpoint of Lojban syntax, ZAhOs are interval modifiers like TAhEs or ROI compounds; if both are found in a single tense, the TAhE/ROI comes first and the ZAhO afterward. The imaginary journey described by other tense cmavo moves us to the portion of the event-as-process which the ZAhO specifies.

The “beginning” of an event is the same whether the event is in the speaker's present, past, or future. It is especially important not to confuse the speaker-relative viewpoint of the PU tenses with the event-relative viewpoint of the ZAhO tenses.

This is the natural result of the event-centered view of ZAhO cmavo. The inchoative, or “pu'o”, part of an event, is in the “pastward” portion of that event, when seen from the perspective of the event itself. It is only by inference that we suppose that <a href=#e10d1>Example 10.1 </a>refers to the speaker's future: in fact, no PU tense is given, so the inchoative part of the event need not be coincident with the speaker's present: “pu'o” is not necessarily, though in fact often is, the same as “ca pu'o”.

There are also two points of time that can be usefully associated with an event: the beginning, marked by “co'a”, and the end, marked by “co'u”. Specifically, “co'a” marks the boundary between the “pu'o” and “ca'o” parts of an event, and “co'u” marks the boundary between the “ca'o” and “ba'o” parts:

Space is not inherently oriented, unlike time, which flows from past to future: therefore, some indication of orientation is necessary, and the “ve'abe'a” provides an orientation in which the south face is the “beginning” and the north face is the “end”, since the rock extends from south (near me) to north (away from me).

In other languages, the metaphor is reversed. Here, Lojban is representing space (or space interval modifiers) by a time-based metaphor: the choice of a FAhA cmavo following a VEhA cmavo indicates which direction is mapped onto the future. (The choice of future rather than past is arbitrary, but convenient for English-speakers.)

There is another major use for tenses in Lojban: as sumti tcita, or argument tags. A tense may be used to add spatial or temporal information to a bridi as, in effect, an additional place:

<p>
<pre><a name=e12d1>12.1)	mi klama le zarci ca le nu do klama le zdani
	I go-to the market [present] the event-of you go-to the house.

What <a href=#e12d1>Example 12.1 </a>asserts is that the action of the main bridi is happening at the same time as the event mentioned by that sumti. So “ca”, which means “now” when used with a selbri, means “simultaneously-with” when used with a sumti. Consider another example:
<p>
<lx "pu">  XE "pu"   <cx "pu, meaning as a sumti tcita">  XE "pu: meaning as a sumti tcita"   <pre><a name=e12d2>12.2)	mi klama le zarci pu le nu do pu klama le zdani
	I go-to the market [past] the event-of you [past] go-to the house.
</pre><p>The second “pu” is simply the past tense marker for the event of your going to the house, and says that this event is in the speaker's past. How are we to understand the first “pu”, the sumti tcita?
<p>
<cx "imaginary journey, starting point">  XE "imaginary journey: starting point"   <cx "imaginary journey, starting at a different point">  XE "imaginary journey: starting at a different point"   All of our imaginary journeys so far have started at the speaker's location in space and time. Now we are specifying an imaginary journey that starts at a different location, namely at the event of your going to the house. <a href=#e12d2>Example 12.2 </a>then says that my going to the market is in the past, relative not to the speaker's present moment, but instead relative to the moment when you went to the house. <a href=#e12d2>Example 12.2 </a>can therefore be translated:

The interpretation of ZAhO tcita differs from that of FAhA, VA, PU, and ZI tcita, however. The event described in the sumti is viewed as a process, and the action of the main bridi occurs at the phase of the process which the ZAhO specifies, or at least some part of that phase. The action of the main bridi itself is seen as a point event, so that there is no issue about which phase of the main bridi is intended. For example:
<p>
<ex "die after living">  XE "die after living: example“  <ex "in the aftermath">  XE "in the aftermath: example“  <pre><a name=e12d6>12.6)	mi morsi ba'o le nu mi jmive
	I am-dead [perfective] the event-of I live.
	I die in the aftermath of my living.
</pre><p>Here the (point-)event of my being dead is the portion of my living-process which occurs after the process is complete. Contrast <a href=#e12d6>Example 12.6 </a>with:

<p>
<pre><a name=e12d7>12.7)	mi morsi ba le nu mi jmive
	I am-dead [future] the event-of I live.
</pre><p>As explained in <a href=#s6>Section 6</a>, <a href=#e12d7>Example 12.7 </a>does not exclude the possibility that I died before I ceased to live!
<p>
Likewise, we might say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d8>12.8)	mi klama le zarci pu'o le nu mi citka
	I go-to the store [inchoative] the event-of I eat
</pre>which indicates that before my eating begins, I go to the store, whereas
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d9>12.9)	mi klama le zarci ba'o le nu mi citka
	I go-to the store [perfective] the event-of I eat
</pre>would indicate that I go to the store after I am finished eating.
<p>
Here is an example which mixes temporal ZAhO (as a tense) and spatial ZAhO (as a sumti tcita):

	The boat sailed for too long and beyond the lake.
</pre><p>Probably it sailed up onto the dock. One point of clarification: although “xelklama” appears to mean simply “is-a-mode-of-transport”, it does not – the bridi of <a href=#e12d10>Example 12.10 </a>has four omitted arguments, and thus has the (physical) journey which goes on too long as part of its meaning.

<a name=s13><h3>Sticky and multiple tenses: KI</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	ki	KI	sticky tense set/reset
</pre><cx "tense, scope of">  XE "tense: scope of"   <cx "sticky tenses, definition">  XE "sticky tenses: definition"   <cx "sticky tense, effect on future tense meaning">  XE "sticky tenses: effect on future tense meaning"   <cx "imaginary journey origin, with sticky tenses">  XE "imaginary journey origin: with sticky tenses"   So far we have only considered tenses in isolated bridi. Lojban provides several ways for a tense to continue in effect over more than a single bridi. This property is known as “stickiness”: the tense gets “stuck” and remains in effect until explicitly “unstuck”. In the metaphor of the imaginary journey, the place and time set by a sticky tense may be thought of as a campsite or way-station: it provides a permanent origin with respect to which other tenses are understood. Later imaginary journeys start from that point rather than from the speaker.
<p>
<lx "ki">  XE "ki"   <lx "KI">  XE "KI selma’o"   To make a tense sticky, suffix “ki” to it:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d1>13.1)	mi puki klama le zarci  .i le nanmu cu batci le gerku
	I [past] [sticky] go-to the market.  The man bites the dog.
	I went to the market. The man bit the dog.
</pre><p>Here the use of “puki” rather than just “pu” ensures that the tense will affect the next sentence as well. Otherwise, since the second sentence is tenseless, there would be no way of determining its tense; the event of the second sentence might happen before, after, or simultaneously with that of the first sentence.
<p>
(The last statement does not apply when the two sentences form part of a narrative. See <a href=#s14>Section 14 </a>for an explanation of “story time”, which employs a different set of conventions.)
<p>
What if the second sentence has a tense anyway?
<p>
<cx "tense, effect of sticky tense on">  XE "tense: effect of sticky tense on"   <ex "had earlier">  XE "had earlier: example“  <pre><a name=e13d2>13.2)	mi puki klama le zarci  .i le nanmu pu batci le gerku
	I [past] sticky go-to the market.  The man [past] bites the dog.
</pre><p>Here the second “pu” does not replace the sticky tense, but adds to it, in the sense that the starting point of its imaginary journey is taken to be the previously set sticky time. So the translation of <a href=#e13d2>Example 13.2 </a>is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d3>13.3)	I went to the market.  The man had earlier bitten the dog.
</pre><cx "tense in scope of sticky tense, compared with compound tense">  XE "tense in scope of sticky tense: compared with compound tense"   <cx "compound tense, compared with tense in scope of sticky tense">  XE "compound tense: compared with tense in scope of sticky tense"   and it is equivalent in meaning (when considered in isolation from any other sentences) to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d4>13.4)	mi pu klama le zarci  .i le nanmu pupu batci le gerku
	I [past] go-to the market.  The man [past] [past] bites the dog.

<p>
<pre><a name=e13d5>13.5)	puku mi ba klama le zarci
	[past] I [future] go-to the market.
	Earlier, I was going to go to the market.
</pre><p>Here there are two tenses in the same bridi, the first floating free and specified by “puku”, the second in the usual place and specified by “ba”. They are considered cumulative in the same way as the two tenses in separate sentences of <a href=#e13d4>Example 13.4</a>. <a href=#e13d5>Example 13.5 </a>is therefore equivalent in meaning, except for emphasis, to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d6>13.6)	mi puba klama le zarci
	I [past] [future] go-to the market.
	I was going to go to the market.
</pre><cx "multiple tenses, effect of order in sentence">  XE "multiple tenses: effect of order in sentence"   Compare <a href=#e13d7>Example 13.7 </a>and <a href=#e13d8>Example 13.8</a>, which have a different meaning from <a href=#e13d5>Example 13.5 </a>and <a href=#e13d6>Example 13.6</a>:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d7>13.7)	mi ba klama le zarci puku
	I [future] go-to the market [past].
	I will have gone to the market earlier.
<a name=e13d8>13.8)	mi bapu klama le zarci
	I [future] [past] go-to the market.
	I will have gone to the market.
</pre><p>So when multiple tense constructs in a single bridi are involved, order counts — the tenses cannot be shifted around as freely as if there were only one tense to worry about.
<p>
<cx "sticky tenses, from part of a multiple tense">  XE "sticky tenses: from part of a multiple tense"   But why bother to allow multiple tense constructs at all? They specify separate portions of the imaginary journey, and can be useful in order to make part of a tense sticky. Consider <a href=#e13d9>Example 13.9</a>, which adds a second bridi and a “ki” to <a href=#e13d5>Example 13.5</a>:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>13.9)	<dd>pukiku mi ba klama le zarci  .i le nanmu cu batci le gerku
	[past] [sticky] I [future] go-to the market.  The man bites the dog.
</dl><p>What is the implied tense of the second sentence? Not “puba”, but only “pu”, since only “pu” was made sticky with “ki”. So the translation is:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>	<dd>I was going to go to the market.  The man bit the dog.
</dl><cx "tense, on embedded bridi">  XE "tense: on embedded bridi"   <cx "tense on main bridi, effect on embedded bridi tenses">  XE "tense on main bridi: effect on embedded bridi tenses"   <cx "tense on main bridi, effect on embedded sumti with tenses">  XE "tense on main bridi: effect on embedded sumti with tenses"   <cx "embedded bridi tenses, effect of main bridi tense on">  XE "embedded bridi tenses: effect of main bridi tense on"   <cx "sumti with tense, effect of main bridi tense on">  XE "sumti with tense: effect of main bridi tense on"   Lojban has several ways of embedding a bridi within another bridi: descriptions, abstractors, relative clauses. (Technically, descriptions contain selbri rather than bridi.) Any of the selbri of these subordinate bridi may have tenses attached. These tenses are interpreted relative to the tense of the main bridi:
<p>
<ex "former market">  XE "former market: example“  <pre><a name=e13d10>13.10)	mi pu klama le ba'o zarci
	I [past] go-to the [perfective] market
	I went to the former market.
</pre><p>The significance of the “ba'o” in <a href=#e13d10>Example 13.10 </a>is that the speaker's destination is described as being “in the aftermath of being a market”; that is, it is a market no longer. In particular, the time at which it was no longer a market is in the speaker's past, because the “ba'o” is interpreted relative to the “pu” tense of the main bridi.
<p>
Here is an example involving an abstraction bridi:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d11>13.11)	mi ca jinvi le du'u mi ba morsi
	I now opine the fact-that I will-be dead.
	I now believe that I will be dead.
</pre><p>Here the event of being dead is said to be in the future with respect to the opinion, which is in the present.
<p>
<cx "sticky tense, canceling">  XE "sticky tenses: canceling"   <cx "ki, with no tense">  XE "ki: with no tense"   “ki” may also be used as a tense by itself. This cancels all stickiness and returns the bridi and all following bridi to the speaker's location in both space and time.

</pre><cx "subscript, for sticky tense">  XE “subscripts: for sticky tense"   <cx "tense, subscripting">  XE "tense: subscripting"   <cx "tense, handling multiple episodes">  XE "tense: handling multiple episodes"   In complex descriptions, multiple tenses may be saved and then used by adding a subscript to “ki”. A time made sticky with “kixipa” (ki-sub-1) can be returned to by specifying “kixipa” as a tense by itself. In the case of written expression, the writer's here-and-now is often different from the reader's, and a pair of subscripted “ki” tenses could be used to distinguish the two.

<p>
<cx "story time, definition">  XE "story time: definition"   <cx "story time, rationale for">  XE "story time: rationale for"   <cx "stories, flow of time in">  XE "stories: flow of time in"   Making strict use of the conventions explained in <a href=#s13>Section 13 </a>would be intolerably awkward when a story is being told. The time at which a story is told by the narrator is usually unimportant to the story. What matters is the flow of time within the story itself. The term “story” in this section refers to any series of statements related in more-or-less time-sequential order, not just a fictional one.
<p>
<cx "story time, as a convention for inferring tense">  XE "story time: as a convention for inferring tense"   <cx "tenseless sentences in story time">  XE "tenseless sentences in story time"   <cx "story time, tenseless sentences in">  XE "story time: tenseless sentences in"   Lojban speakers use a different set of conventions, commonly called “story time”, for inferring tense within a story. It is presumed that the event described by each sentence takes place some time more or less after the previous ones. Therefore, tenseless sentences are implicitly tensed as “what happens next”. In particular, any sticky time setting is advanced by each sentence.
<p>
The following mini-story illustrates the important features of story time. A sentence-by-sentence explication follows:

</pre><cx "story tense, Lojban convention contrasted with English convention">  XE "story tense: Lojban convention contrasted with English convention"   <a href=#e14d1>Example 14.1 </a>sets both the time (long ago) and the place (in a cave) using “ki”, just like the sentence sequences in <a href=#s13>Section 13</a>. No further space cmavo are used in the rest of the story, so the place is assumed to remain unchanged. The English translation of <a href=#e14d1>Example 14.1 </a>is marked for past tense also, as the conventions of English storytelling require: consequently, all other English translation sentences are also in the past tense. (We don't notice how strange this is; even stories about the future are written in past tense!) This conventional use of past tense is not used in Lojban narratives.
<p>
<a href=#e14d2>Example 14.2 </a>is tenseless. Outside story time, it would be assumed that its event happens simultaneously with that of <a href=#e14d1>Example 14.1</a>, since a sticky tense is in effect; the rules of story time, however, imply that the event occurs afterwards, and that the story time has advanced (changing the sticky time set in <a href=#e14d1>Example 14.1</a>).
<p>
<a href=#e14d3>Example 14.3 </a>has an explicit tense. This is taken relative to the latest setting of the sticky time; therefore, the event of <a href=#e14d3>Example 14.3 </a>happens before that of <a href=#e14d2>Example 14.2</a>. It cannot be determined if <a href=#e14d3>Example 14.3 </a>happens before or after <a href=#e14d1>Example 14.1</a>.
<p>
<ex "flashbacks in story time">  XE "flashbacks in story time: example“  <a href=#e14d4>Example 14.4 </a>is again tenseless. Story time was not changed by the flashback in <a href=#e14d3>Example 14.3</a>, so <a href=#e14d4>Example 14.4 </a>happens after <a href=#e14d2>Example 14.2</a>.
<p>
<a href=#e14d5>Example 14.5 </a>specifies the future (relative to <a href=#e14d4>Example 14.4</a>) and makes it sticky. So all further events happen after <a href=#e14d5>Example 14.5</a>.
<p>
<a href=#e14d6>Example 14.6 </a>and <a href=#e14d7>Example 14.7 </a>are again tenseless, and so happen after <a href=#e14d5>Example 14.5</a>. (Story time is changed.)
<p>
So the overall order is 14.1 - 14.3 - 14.2 - 14.4 - (medium interval) - 14.5 - 14.6 - 14.7. It is also possible that 14.3 happens before 14.1.
<p>
<cx "story time, with no initial sticky time">  XE "story time: with no initial sticky time"   If no sticky time (or space) is set initially, the story is set at an unspecified time (or space): the effect is like that of choosing an arbitrary reference point and making it sticky. This style is common in stories that are jokes. The same convention may be used if the context specifies the sticky time sufficiently.

<a name=s15><h3>Tenses in subordinate bridi</h3>
<p>
<cx "subordinate clauses, tense usage rules in English">  XE "subordinate clauses: tense usage rules in English"   English has a set of rules, formally known as “sequence of tense rules”, for determining what tense should be used in a subordinate clause, depending on the tense used in the main sentence. Here are some examples:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d1>15.1)	John says that George is going to the market.
<a name=e15d2>15.2)	John says that George went to the market.
<a name=e15d3>15.3)	John said that George went to the market.
<a name=e15d4>15.4)	John said that George had gone to the market.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e15d1>Example 15.1 </a>and <a href=#e15d2>Example 15.2</a>, the tense of the main sentence is the present: “says”. If George goes when John speaks, we get the present tense “is going” (“goes” would be unidiomatic); if George goes before John speaks, we get the past tense “went”. But if the tense of the main sentence is the past, with “said”, then the tense required in the subordinate clause is different. If George goes when John speaks, we get the past tense “went”; if George goes before John speaks, we get the past-perfect tense “had gone”.
<p>
The rule of English, therefore, is that both the tense of the main sentence and the tense of the subordinate clause are understood relative to the speaker of the main sentence (not John, but the person who speaks <a href=#e15d{1}>Examples 15.1 </a>through <a href=#e15d4>15.4</a>).
<p>
<cx "sequence of tense rules, Lojban contrasted with English">  XE "sequence of tense rules: Lojban contrasted with English"   <cx "subordinate clause tense, Lojban contrasted with English">  XE "subordinate clause tense: Lojban contrasted with English"   <cx "subordinate clause tense, Lojban compared with Russian">  XE "subordinate clause tense: Lojban compared with Russian"   <cx "subordinate clause tense, Lojban compared with Esperanto">  XE "subordinate clause tense: Lojban compared with Esperanto"   <cx "subordinate clause tense, effect of main bridi tense on">  XE "subordinate clause tense: effect of main bridi tense on"   Lojban, like Russian and Esperanto, uses a different convention. A tense in a subordinate bridi is understood to be relative to the tense already set in the main bridi. Thus <a href=#e15d{1}>Examples 15.1 </a>through <a href=#e15d4>15.4 </a>can be expressed in Lojban respectively thus:
<p>
<ex "John says that George goes to market">  XE "John says that George goes to market: example“  <pre><a name=e15d5>15.5)	la djan. ca cusku le se du'u la djordj. ca klama le zarci
	John [present] says the statement-that George [present] goes-to the market.
<a name=e15d6>15.6)	la djan. ca cusku le se du'u la djordj. pu klama le zarci
	John [present] says the statement-that George [past] goes-to the market.
<a name=e15d7>15.7)	la djan. pu cusku le se du'u la djordj. ca klama le zarci
	John [past] says the statement-that George [present] goes-to the market.
<a name=e15d8>15.8)	la djan. pu cusku le se du'u la djordj. pu klama le zarci
	John [past] says the statement-that George [past] goes-to the market.
</pre><p>Probably the most counterintuitive of the Lojban examples is <a href=#e15d7>Example 15.7</a>. The “ca” looks quite odd, as if George were going to the market right now, rather than back when John spoke. But this “ca” is really a “ca” with respect to a reference point specified by the outer “pu”. This behavior is the same as the additive behavior of multiple tenses in the same bridi, as explained in <a href=#s13>Section 13</a>.

(Yes, it sounds like English “now”.) It is not grammatical to combine “nau” with any other cmavo in a tense, except by way of a logical or non-logical connection (see <a href=#s20>Section 20</a>). Here is a convoluted sentence with several nested bridi which uses “nau” at the lowest level:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d9>15.9)	la djan. pu cusku le se du'u la .alis pu cusku le se du'u

By the nature of “le nu”, the man's biting the dog is merely referred to without being claimed. If it seems desirable to claim both, each event can be expressed as a main sentence bridi, with a special form of “.i” connecting them:
<p>
<pre><a name=e16d2>16.2)	le nanmu cu batci le gerku  .izu'abo le verba cu cadzu le bisli
	The man bites the dog.  [Left] the child walks-on the ice.
	The man bites the dog.  To the left, the child walks on the ice.
</pre>“.izu'abo” is a compound cmavo: the “.i” separates the sentences and the “zu'a” is the tense. The “bo” is required to prevent the “zu'a” from gobbling up the following sumti, namely “le verba”.

With “.izu'abo” (and all other afterthought tense connectives) the sentence specifying the origin of the journey comes first. This is a natural order for sentences, but requires some care when converting between this form and the sumti tcita form.
<p>
<a href=#e16d2>Example 16.2 </a>means the same thing as:

	The man bites the dog. To the left of the child, something walks on the ice.

</pre><p>In <a href=#e16d5>Example 16.5</a>, the origin point is the speaker, as is usual with “zu'aku”. <a href=#e16d2>Example 16.2 </a>makes the origin point of the tense the event described by the first sentence.
<p>
<cx "tense connected sentences, forethought mode">  XE "tense connected sentences: forethought mode"   Two sentences may also be connected in forethought by a tense relationship. Just like afterthought tense connection, forethought tense connection claims both sentences, and in addition claims that the time or space relationship specified by the tense holds between the events the two sentences describe.

<pre><a name=e18d9>18.9)	le verba na'e ri'u cadzu le bisli
	The child [non-] [right] walks-on the ice
	The child walks on the ice other than to my right.
</pre><cx "TAhE, scalar negation of">  XE "TAhE selma’o: scalar negation of"   <cx "ROI, scalar negation of">  XE "ROI selma’o: scalar negation of"   The use of “-nai” on cmavo of TAhE and ROI has already been discussed in <a href=#s9>Section 9</a>; this use is also a scalar negation.

<p>
<a name=s19><h3>Actuality, potentiality, capability: CAhA</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	ca'a	CAhA	actually is
	ka'e	CAhA	is innately capable of
	nu'o	CAhA	can but has not
	pu'i	CAhA	can and has
</pre><cx "potential events, expressing implicitly">  XE "potential events: expressing implicitly"   <cx "innate capabilities, expressing implicitly">  XE "innate capability: expressing implicitly"   Lojban bridi without tense markers may not necessarily refer to actual events: they may also refer to capabilities or potential events. For example:
<p>
<ex "ducks swim">  XE "ducks swim: example“  <pre><a name=e19d1>19.1)	ro datka cu flulimna
	All ducks are-float-swimmers
	All ducks swim by floating.
</pre><cx "tense, Lojban contrasted with English in implying actuality">  XE "tense: Lojban contrasted with English in implying actuality"   <cx "actuality, Lojban contrasted with English in implying">  XE "actuality: Lojban contrasted with English in implying"   is a Lojban truth, even though the colloquial English translation is false or at best ambiguous. This is because the tenseless Lojban bridi doesn't necessarily claim that every duck is swimming or floating now or even at a specific time or place. Even if we add a tense marker to <a href=#e19d1>Example 19.1</a>,
<p>
<pre><a name=e19d2>19.2)	ro datka ca flulimna
	All ducks [present] are-float-swimmers.
	All ducks are now swimming by floating.
</pre>the resulting <a href=#e19d2>Example 19.2 </a>might still be considered a truth, even though the colloquial English seems even more likely to be false. All ducks have the potential of swimming even if they are not exercising that potential at present. To get the full flavor of “All ducks are now swimming”, we must append a marker from selma'o CAhA to the tense, and say:
<p>
<cx "actual events, explicitly expressing">  XE "actual events: explicitly expressing"   <lx "ca'a">  XE "ca'a"   <pre><a name=e19d3>19.3)	ro datka ca ca'a flulimna
	All ducks [present] [actual] are-float-swimmers
	All ducks are now actually swimming by floating.
</pre><cx "CAhA, order in tense construct">  XE "CAhA selma’o: order in tense construct"   <lx "CAhA">  XE "CAhA selma’o"   <lx "ki">  XE "ki"   <cx "CAhA, making sticky">  XE "CAhA selma’o: making sticky"   <cx "sticky tenses, and CAhA">  XE "sticky tenses: and CAhA"   A CAhA cmavo is always placed after any other tense cmavo, whether for time or for space. However, a CAhA cmavo comes before “ki”, so that a CAhA condition can be made sticky.
<p>
<a href=#e19d3>Example 19.3 </a>is false in both Lojban and English, since it claims that the swimming is an actual, present fact, true of every duck that exists, whereas in fact there is at least one duck that is not swimming now.
<p>
<cx "innate capability, expressing explicitly">  XE "innate capability: expressing explicitly"   <lx "ka'e">  XE "ka'e"   Furthermore, some ducks are dead (and therefore sink); some ducks have just hatched (and do not know how to swim yet), and some ducks have been eaten by predators (and have ceased to exist as separate objects at all). Nevertheless, all these ducks have the innate capability of swimming — it is part of the nature of duckhood. The cmavo “ka'e” expresses this notion of innate capability:
<p>
<pre><a name=e19d4>19.4)	ro datka ka'e flulimna
	All ducks [capable] are-float-swimmers.
	All ducks are innately capable of swimming.
</pre><cx "innate properties, extension of from mass to individuals">  XE "innate property: extension of from mass to individuals"   Under some epistemologies, innate capability can be extended in order to apply the innate properties of a mass to which certain individuals belong to the individuals themselves, even if those individuals are themselves not capable of fulfilling the claim of the bridi. For example:
<p>
<ex "can see">  XE "can see: example“  <pre><a name=e19d5>19.5)	la djan. ka'e viska
	John [capable] sees.
	John is innately capable of seeing.
	John can see.
</pre><cx "innate properties, extension to individuals not actually capable">  XE "innate property: extension to individuals not actually capable"   might be true about a human being named John, even though he has been blind since birth, because the ability to see is innately built into his nature as a human being. It is theoretically possible that conditions might occur that would enable John to see (an operation, for example). On the other hand,
<p>
<pre><a name=e19d6>19.6)	le cukta ka'e viska
	The book [capable] sees.
	The book can see.
</pre>is not true in most epistemologies, since the ability to see is not part of the innate nature of a book.
<p>
<cx "undemonstrated potential, expressing">  XE "undemonstrated potential: expressing"   Consider once again the newly hatched ducks mentioned earlier. They have the potential of swimming, but have not yet demonstrated that potential. This may be expressed using “nu'o”, the cmavo of CAhA for undemonstrated potential:
<p>
<ex "infant ducks">  XE "infant ducks: example“  <lx "nu'o">  XE "nu'o"   <pre><a name=e19d7>19.7)	ro cifydatka nu'o flulimna
	All infant-ducks [can but has not] are-float-swimmers.
	All infant ducks have an undemonstrated potential for swimming by floating.
	Baby ducks can swim but haven't yet.
</pre><cx "demonstrated potential, expressing">  XE "demonstrated potential: expressing"   Contrariwise, if Frank is not blind from birth, then “pu'i” is appropriate:
<p>
<lx "pu'i">  XE "pu'i"   <pre><a name=e19d8>19.8)	la frank. pu'i viska
	Frank [can and has] sees.
	Frank has demonstrated a potential for seeing.
	Frank can see and has seen.
</pre><cx "potential, expressing in past/future">  XE "potential: expressing in past/future"   <cx "actuality, expressing in past/future">  XE "actuality: expressing in past/future"   Note that the glosses given at the beginning of this section for “ca'a”, “nu'o”, and “pu'i” incorporate “ca” into their meaning, and are really correct for “ca ca'a”, “ca nu'o”, and “ca pu'i”. However, the CAhA cmavo are perfectly meaningful with other tenses than the present:
<p>
<pre><a name=e19d9>19.9)	mi pu ca'a klama le zarci
	I [past] [actual] go-to the store.
	I actually went to the store.
<a name=e19d10>19.10)	la frank. ba nu'o klama le zdani
	Frank [future] [can but has not] goes-to the store.
	Frank could have, but will not have, gone to the store (at some understood
moment in the future).
</pre><cx "tenses with elided CAhA, meaning">  XE “tense with elided CAhA: meaning"   As always in Lojban tenses, a missing CAhA can have an indeterminate meaning, or the context can be enough to disambiguate it. Saying
<p>
<pre><a name=e19d11>19.11)	ta jelca
	That burns/is-burning/might-burn/will-burn.
</pre><ex "inflammable">  XE "inflammable: example“  with no CAhA specified can translate the two very different English sentences “That is on fire” and “That is inflammable.” The first demands immediate action (usually), whereas the second merely demands caution. The two cases can be disambiguated with:
<p>
<pre><a name=e19d12>19.12)	ta ca ca'a jelca
	That [present] [actual] burns.
	That is on fire.
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e19d13>19.13)	ta ka'e jelca
	That [capable] burns.
	That is capable of burning.
	That is inflammable.
</pre><cx "observative with elided CAhA, convention">  XE "observative with elided CAhA: convention"   When no indication is given, as in the simple observative
<p>
<pre><a name=e19d14>19.14)	jelca
	It burns!
</pre>the prudent Lojbanist will assume the meaning “Fire!”
<p>
<a name=s20><h3>Logical and non-logical connections between tenses</h3>
<p>
Like many things in Lojban, tenses may be logically connected; logical connection is explained in more detail in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>. Some of the terminology in this section will be clear only if you already understand logical connectives.
<p>
<lx "JA">  XE "JA selma’o"   <cx "logically connected tenses, with JA">  XE "logically connected tenses: with JA"   <cx "tenses, logically connected with JA">  XE “tense: logically connected with JA"   <cx "logically connected tenses, expansion to sentences">  XE "logically connected tenses: expansion to sentences"   The appropriate logical connectives belong to selma'o JA. A logical connective between tenses can always be expanded to one between sentences:
<p>
<pre><a name=e20d1>20.1)	mi pu je ba klama le zarci
	I [past] and [future] go-to the market.
	I went and will go to the market.
</pre>means the same as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e20d2>20.2)	mi pu klama le zarci  .ije mi ba klama le zarci
	I [past] go-to the market.  And I [future] go-to the market.
	I went to the market, and I will go to the market.
</pre><cx "tenses, connected, with negation">  XE “tense: connected, with negation"   Tense connection and tense negation are combined in:
<p>
<pre><a name=e20d3>20.3)	mi punai je canai je ba klama le zarci
	I [past] [not] and [present] [not] and [future] go-to the market.
	I haven't yet gone to the market, but I will in future.
</pre><a href=#e20d3>Example 20.3 </a>is far more specific than
<p>
<pre><a name=e20d4>20.4)	mi ba klama le zarci
	I [future] go-to the market.
</pre>which only says that I will go, without claiming anything about my past or present. “ba” does not imply “punai” or “canai”; to compel that interpretation, either a logical connection or a ZAhO is needed.
<p>
<cx "connected tenses, negation of compared with negation in connective">  XE "connected tenses: negation of compared with negation in connective"   Tense negation can often be removed in favor of negation in the logical connective itself. The following examples are equivalent in meaning:
<p>
<pre><a name=e20d5>20.5)	mi mo'izu'anai je mo'iri'u cadzu
	I [motion] [left-not] and [motion] [right] walk.
	I walk not leftward but rightward.
<a name=e20d6>20.6)	mi mo'izu'a naje mo'iri'u cadzu
	I [motion] [left] not-and [motion] [right] walk.
	I walk not leftward but rightward.
</pre><cx "tenses, forethought logical connections">  XE “tense: forethought logical connections"   <cx "tenses, possible groupings of">  XE “tense: possible groupings of"   There are no forethought logical connections between tenses allowed by the grammar, to keep tenses simpler. Nor is there any way to override simple left-grouping of the connectives, the Lojban default.
<p>
<cx "tenses, non-logical connection of">  XE “tense: non-logical connection of"   <lx "JOI">  XE "JOI selma’o"   <lx "BIhI">  XE "BIhI selma’o"   <lx "GAhO">  XE "GAhO selma’o"   <cx "intervals, expressing by endpoints with bi'o">  XE "interval: expressing by endpoints with bi'o"   The non-logical connectives of selma'o JOI, BIhI, and GAhO are also permitted between tenses. One application is to specify intervals not by size, but by their end-points (“bi'o” belongs to selma'o BIhI, and connects the end-points of an ordered interval, like English “from <dots>…</dots>to”):
<p>
<pre><a name=e20d7>20.7)	mi puza bi'o bazu vasxu
	I [past] [medium] from <dots>…</dots>to [future] [long] breathe.
	I breathe from a medium time ago till a long time to come.
</pre>(It is to be hoped that I have a long life ahead of me.)
<p>
One additional use of non-logical connectives within tenses is discussed in <a href=#s21>Section 21</a>. Other uses will probably be identified in future.
<p>
<a name=s21><h3>Sub-events</h3>
<p>
<ex "six-shooter">  XE "six-shooter: example“  <cx "tenses, non-logical connection of for sub-events">  XE “tense: non-logical connection of for sub-events"   Another application of non-logical tense connection is to talk about sub-events of events. Consider a six-shooter: a gun which can fire six bullets in succession before reloading. If I fire off the entire magazine twice, I can express the fact in Lojban thus:
<p>
<ex "on two occasions">  XE "on two occasions: example“  <pre><a name=e21d1>21.1)	mi reroi pi'u xaroi cecla le seldanti
	I [twice] [cross-product] [six times] shoot the projectile-launcher.
	On two occasions, I fire the gun six times.
</pre><lx "pi'u">  XE "pi'u"   <cx "pi'u, use in connecting tenses">  XE "pi'u: use in connecting tenses"   <cx "Cartesian product, with tenses">  XE "Cartesian product: with tenses"   <cx "cross product, with tenses">  XE "cross product: with tenses"   It would be confusing, though grammatical, to run the “reroi” and the “xaroi” directly together. However, the non-logical connective “pi'u” expresses a Cartesian product (also known as a cross product) of two sets. In this case, there is a set of two firings each of which is represented by a set of six shots, for twelve shots in all (hence the name “product”: the product of 2 and 6 is 12). Its use specifies very precisely what occurs.
<p>
<cx "interval properties, strings of">  XE "interval properties: strings of"   <cx "event contours, strings of">  XE "event contours: strings of"   In fact, you can specify strings of interval properties and event contours within a single tense without the use of a logical or non-logical connective cmavo. This allows tenses of the type:
<p>
<pre><a name=e21d2>21.2)	la djordj. ca'o co'a ciska
	George [continuitive] [initiative] writes.
	George continues to start to write.
<a name=e21d3>21.3)	mi reroi ca'o xaroi darxi le damri
	I [twice] [continuitive] [six times] hit the drum.
	On two occasions, I continue to beat the drum six times.
</pre><a name=s22><h3>Conversion of sumti tcita: JAI</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	jai	JAI	tense conversion
	fai	FA	indefinite place
</pre><lx "SE">  XE "SE selma’o"   <cx "conversion, definition">  XE "conversion: definition"   Conversion is the regular Lojban process of moving around the places of a place structure. The cmavo of selma'o SE serve this purpose, exchanging the first place with one of the others:
<p>
<pre><a name=e22d1>22.1)	mi cu klama le zarci
	I go-to the market.
<a name=e22d2>22.2)	le zarci cu se klama mi

<p>
<ex "rat eats cheese in park">  XE "rat eats cheese in park: example“  <pre><a name=e22d3>22.3)	le ratcu cu citka le cirla vi le panka
	The rat eats the cheese [short distance] the park.
	The rat eats the cheese in the park.
<a name=e22d4>22.4)	le panka cu jai vi citka le cirla fai le ratcu
	The park is-the-place-of eating the cheese by-the rat.
	The park is where the rat eats the cheese.
</pre><cx "tense conversion, accessing original first place with fai">  XE "tense conversion: accessing original first place with fai"   <lx "fai">  XE "fai"   <lx "FA">  XE "FA selma’o"   In <a href=#e22d4>Example 22.4</a>, the construction JAI+tense converts the location sumti into the first place. The previous first place has nowhere to go, since the location sumti is not a numbered place; however, it can be inserted back into the bridi with “fai”, the indefinite member of selma'o FA.
<p>
(The other members of FA are used to mark the first, second, etc. places of a bridi explicitly:
<p>
<pre><a name=e22d5>22.5)	fa mi cu klama fe le zarci
</pre>means the same as
<p>
<pre><a name=e22d6>22.6)	fe le zarci cu klama fa mi
</pre>as well as the simple
<p>
<pre><a name=e22d7>22.7)	mi cu klama le zarci
</pre>in which the place structure is determined by position.)
<p>
<cx "tense conversion, use in sumti descriptions">  XE "tense conversion: use in sumti descriptions"   <lx "LE">  XE "LE selma’o"   Like SE conversion, JAI+tense conversion is especially useful in descriptions with LE selma'o:
<p>
<ex "place of eating">  XE "place of eating: example“  <pre><a name=e22d8>22.8)	mi viska le jai vi citka be le cirla
	I saw the place-of eating the cheese.
</pre><p>Here the eater of the cheese is elided, so no “fai” appears.

<p>
<cx "tense conversion, of temporal tenses">  XE "tense conversion: of temporal tenses"   Of course, temporal tenses are also usable with JAI:
<p>
<ex "time of death">  XE "time of death: example“  <pre><a name=e22d9>22.9)	mi djuno fi le jai ca morsi be fai la djan.
	I know about the [present] is-dead of-the-one-called “John”
	I know the time of John's death.

<p>
<cx "tenses, compared with modals in syntax">  XE “tense: compared with modals in syntax"   <cx "modals, compared with tenses in syntax">  XE "modals: compared with tenses in syntax"   <cx "tenses, contrasted with modals in semantics">  XE “tense: contrasted with modals in semantics"   <cx "modals, contrasted with tenses in semantics">  XE "modals: contrasted with tenses in semantics"   Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly paralleled by some use of modals as explained in <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be maintained.
<p>
<cx "modals, importance of 1st sumti place for sumti tcita use">  XE "modals: importance of 1st sumti place for sumti tcita use"   The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi
<p>
<pre><a name=e23d1>23.1)	mi nelci do mu'i le nu do nelci mi
	I like you with-motivation the event-of you like me.
	I like you because you like me.
</pre>places the “le nu” sumti in the x1 place of the gismu “mukti” (which underlies the modal “mu'i”), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
<p>
<cx "tenses, importance of 2nd sumti place for sumti tcita use">  XE “tense: importance of 2nd sumti place for sumti tcita use"   <pre><a name=e23d2>23.2)	mi nelci do ba le nu do nelci mi
	I like you after the event-of you like me.
	I like you after you like me.
</pre>places the “le nu” sumti in the x2 place of the gismu “balvi” (which underlies the tense “ba”), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of <a href=#e23d1>Example 23.1 </a>and <a href=#e23d2>Example 23.2</a>, employing the brivla “mukti” and “balvi” explicitly, would be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e23d3>23.3)	le nu do nelci mi cu mukti le nu mi nelci do
	The event-of you like me motivates the event-of I like you
	Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e23d4>23.4)	le nu mi nelci do cu balvi le nu do nelci mi
	The event-of I like you is after the event of you like me.
	My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.
</pre>(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed; <a href=#e23d3>Example 23.3 </a>and <a href=#e23d4>Example 23.4 </a>claim only the causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events themselves.)
<p>
<cx "afterthought sentence connection, modal contrasted with tense">  XE "afterthought sentence connection: modal contrasted with tense"   As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of <a href=#e23d1>Example 23.1 </a>and <a href=#e23d2>Example 23.2 </a>are, respectively:
<p>
<pre><a name=e23d5>23.5)	mi nelci do .imu'ibo do nelci mi
	I like you. [That is] Because you like me.
<a name=e23d6>23.6)	do nelci mi .ibabo mi nelci do
	You like me. Afterward, I like you.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e23d5>Example 23.5</a>, the order of the two bridi “mi nelci do” and “do nelci mi” is the same as in <a href=#e23d1>Example 23.1</a>. In <a href=#e23d6>Example 23.6</a>, however, the order is reversed: the origin point “do nelci mi” physically appears before the future-time event “mi nelci do”. In both cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi characterizing the event in the x1 place of “mukti” or “balvi”.

The main English tense question words are “When?” and “Where?”. These may be paraphrased respectively as “At what time?” and “At what place?” In these forms, their Lojban equivalents simply involve a tense plus “ma”, the Lojban sumti question:
<p>
<ex "when">  XE "when: example“  <pre><a name=e24d1>24.1)	do klama le zdani ca ma

Explicit magnitudes</h3>
<p><cx "explicit magnitude">  XE "explicit magnitude"   <cx "tense magnitude">  XE "tense magnitude"   <cx "magnitude, tense">  XE "magnitude: tense"   <a name=s25><h3>
It is a limitation of the VA and ZI system of specifying magnitudes that they can only prescribe vague magnitudes: small, medium, or large. In order to express both an origin point and an exact distance, the Lojban construction called a “termset” is employed. (Termsets are explained further in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14 </a>and <a href=chap16.html>Chapter 16</a>.) It is grammatical for a termset to be placed after a tense or modal tag rather than a sumti, which allows both the origin of the imaginary journey and its distance to be specified. Here is an example:

<p>
<pre><a name=e25d1>25.1)	la frank. sanli zu'a nu'i la djordj.
		lu'a lo mitre be li mu [nu'u]
	Frank stands [left] [start termset] George
		[quantity] a thing-measuring-in-meters the-number 5 [end termset].
	Frank is standing five meters to the left of George.
</pre><p>Here the termset extends from the “nu'i” to the implicit “nu'u” at the end of the sentence, and includes the terms “la djordj.”, which is the unmarked origin point, and the tagged sumti “lo mitre be li mu”, which the cmavo “la'u” (of selma'o BAI, and meaning “with quantity”; see <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>) marks as a quantity. Both terms are governed by the tag “zu'a”.
<p>
It is not necessary to have both an origin point and an explicit magnitude: a termset may have only a single term in it. A less precise version of <a href=#e25d1>Example 25.1 </a>is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e25d2>25.2)	la frank. sanli zu'a nu'i lu'a

<p>
The syntax of abstraction</h3>
<p><cx "abstraction, syntax">  XE "abstraction(s): syntax"   <cx "NU, syntax">  XE "NU selma’o: syntax"   <a name=s1><h3>
<cx "clause, subordinate using abstraction">  XE "clause: subordinate using abstraction"   <cx "gerund, using abstraction">  XE "gerund: using abstraction"   The purpose of the feature of Lojban known as “abstraction” is to provide a means for taking whole bridi and packaging them up, as it were, into simple selbri. Syntactically, abstractions are very simple and uniform; semantically, they are rich and complex, with few features in common between one variety of abstraction and another. We will begin by discussing syntax without regard to semantics; as a result, the notion of abstraction may seem unmotivated at first. Bear with this difficulty until <a href=#s2>Section 2</a>.
<p>
<lx "NU">  XE "NU selma’o"   <lx "kei">  XE "kei"   <lx "KEI">  XE "KEI selma’o"   An abstraction selbri is formed by taking a full bridi and preceding it by any cmavo of selma'o NU. There are twelve such cmavo; they are known as “abstractors”. The bridi is closed by the elidable terminator “kei”, of selma'o KEI. Thus, to change the bridi
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	mi klama le zarci
	I go-to the store.
</pre>into an abstraction using “nu”, one of the members of selma'o NU, we change it into
<p>
<cx "observatives, and abstractions">  XE "observatives: and abstractions"   <pre><a name=e1d2>1.2)	nu mi klama le zarci [kei]
	an-event-of my going-to the store
</pre><cx "KEI, eliding">  XE "KEI selma’o: eliding"   The bridi may be a simple selbri, or it may have associated sumti, as here. It is important to beware of eliding “kei” improperly, as many of the common uses of abstraction selbri involve following them with words that would appear to be part of the abstraction if “kei” had been elided.
<p>
(Technically, “kei” is never necessary, because the elidable terminator “vau” that closes every bridi can substitute for it; however, “kei” is specific to abstractions, and using it is almost always clearer.)
<p>
<cx "abstraction, grammatical uses">  XE "abstraction(s): grammatical uses"   <cx "tanru, and abstractions">  XE "tanru: and abstractions"   The grammatical uses of an abstraction selbri are exactly the same as those of a simple brivla. In particular, abstraction selbri may be used as observatives, as in <a href=#e1d2>Example 1.2</a>, or used in tanru:
<p>
<ex "want to be a soldier">  XE "want to be a soldier: example“  <pre><a name=e1d3>1.3)	la djan. cu nu sonci kei djica
	John is-an-(event-of being-a-soldier) type-of desirer.
	John wants to be a soldier.
</pre><cx "descriptions, and abstractions">  XE "descriptions: and abstractions"   Abstraction selbri may also be used in descriptions, preceded by “le” (or any other member of selma'o LE):
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d4>1.4)	la djan. cu djica le nu sonci [kei]
	John desires the event-of being-a-soldier.
</pre><p>We will most often use descriptions containing abstraction either at the end of a bridi, or just before the main selbri with its “cu”; in either of these circumstances, “kei” can normally be elided.
<p>
<cx "abstractions, place structure">  XE "abstraction(s): place structure"   The place structure of an abstraction selbri depends on the particular abstractor, and will be explained individually in the following sections.
<p>
Note: In glosses of bridi within abstractions, the grammatical form used in the English changes. Thus, in the gloss of <a href=#e1d2>Example 1.2 </a>we see “my going-to the store” rather than “I go-to the store”; likewise, in the glosses of <a href=#e1d3>Example 1.3 </a>and <a href=#e1d4>Example 1.4 </a>we see “being-a-soldier” rather than “is-a-soldier”. This procedure reflects the desire for more understandable glosses, and does not indicate any change in the Lojban form. A bridi is a bridi, and undergoes no change when it is used as part of an abstraction selbri.
<p>
Event abstraction</h3>
<p><cx "event abstractions">  XE "event abstractions"   <cx "abstractions, event">  XE "abstraction(s): event"   <a name=s2><h3>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	nu	NU	event abstractor
</pre><cx "common abstractor">  XE "common abstractor"   <lx "nu">  XE "nu"   <lx "NU">  XE "NU selma’o"   <cx "nu, definition">  XE "nu: definition"   <cx "le nu, definition">  XE "le nu: definition"   The examples in <a href=#s1>Section 1 </a>made use of “nu” as the abstractor, and it is certainly the most common abstractor in Lojban text. Its purpose is to capture the event or state of the bridi considered as a whole. Do not confuse the “le” description built on a “nu” abstraction with ordinary descriptions based on “le” alone. The following sumti are quite distinct:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	le klama
	the comer, that which comes
<a name=e2d2>2.2)	le se klama
	the destination
<a name=e2d3>2.3)	le te klama
	the origin
<a name=e2d4>2.4)	le ve klama
	the route
<a name=e2d5>2.5)	le xe klama
	the means of transportation
<a name=e2d6>2.6)	le nu klama
	the event of someone coming to somewhere from somewhere by some route
using some means
</pre><a href=#e2d{1}>Examples 2.1 </a>through <a href=#e2d5>2.5 </a>are descriptions that isolate the five individual sumti places of the selbri “klama”. <a href=#e2d6>Example 2.6 </a>describes something associated with the bridi as a whole: the event of it.
<p>
<cx "events, duration">  XE "events: duration"   In Lojban, the term “event” is divorced from its ordinary English sense of something that happens over a short period of time. The description:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d7>2.7)	le nu mi vasxu
	the event-of my breathing
</pre>is an event which lasts for the whole of my life (under normal circumstances). On the other hand,
<p>
  XE "kissing Jane, example"  <pre><a name=e2d8>2.8)	le nu la djan. cinba la djein.
	the event-of John kissing Jane
</pre><cx "normal circumstances">  XE "normal circumstances"   is relatively brief by comparison (again, under normal circumstances).
<p>
<cx "abstraction, sumti ellipsis in">  XE "abstraction(s): sumti ellipsis in"   We can see from <a href=#e2d{6}>Examples 2.6 </a>through <a href=#e2d8>2.8 </a>that ellipsis of sumti is valid in the bridi of abstraction selbri, just as in the main bridi of a sentence. Any sumti may be ellipsized if the listener will be able to figure out from context what the proper value of it is, or else to recognize that the proper value is unimportant. It is extremely common for “nu” abstractions in descriptions to have the x1 place ellipsized:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d9>2.9)	mi nelci le nu limna
	I like the event-of swimming.
	I like swimming.
</pre>is elliptical, and most probably means:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d10>2.10)	mi nelci le nu mi limna
	I like the event-of I swim.
</pre><p>In the proper context, of course, <a href=#e2d9>Example 2.9 </a>could refer to the event of somebody else swimming. Its English equivalent, “I like swimming”, can't be interpreted as “I like Frank's swimming”; this is a fundamental distinction between English and Lojban. In Lojban, an omitted sumti can mean whatever the context indicates that it should mean.
<p>
<cx "abstraction, implicit in sumti">  XE "abstraction(s): implicit in sumti"   Note that the lack of an explicit NU cmavo in a sumti can sometimes hide an implicit abstraction. In the context of <a href=#e2d10>Example 2.10</a>, the appearance of “le se nelci” (“that which is liked”) is in effect an abstraction:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d11>2.11)	le se nelci cu cafne
	The liked-thing is-frequent.
	The thing which I like happens often.
</pre>which in this context means
<p>
<dl compact><dt>	<dd>My swimming happens often.
</dl><p>Event descriptions with “le nu” are commonly used to fill the “under conditions <dots>…</dots>” places, among others, of gismu and lujvo place structures:
<p>
<ex "under conditions">  XE "under conditions: example“  <pre><a name=e2d12>2.12)	la lojban. cu frili mi le nu mi tadni [kei]
	Lojban is-easy for-me under-conditions-the event-of I study
	Lojban is easy for me when I study.
</pre>(The “when” of the English would also be appropriate for a construction involving a Lojban tense, but the Lojban sentence says more than that the studying is concurrent with the ease.)
<p>

</pre><p>Event abstractions with “nu” suffice to express all kinds of events, whether long, short, unique, repetitive, or whatever. Lojban also has more finely discriminating machinery for talking about events, however. There are four other abstractors of selma'o NU for talking about four specific types of events, or four ways of looking at the same event.

(This latter word should be divorced, in this context, from all connotations of success or triumph.) A point-event can be extended in duration, but it is still a point-event if it is thought of as unitary, having no internal structure. The abstractor “mu'e” means “point-event-of”:
<p>
<cx "killing Jim">  XE "killing Jim"   <ex "killing Jim">  XE "killing Jim: example“  <pre><a name=e3d1>3.1)	le mu'e la djan. catra la djim. cu zekri

<p>
Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d3>4.3)	do cnino mi le ka xunre [kei]
	You are-new to-me in-the-quality-of-the property-of being-red.
	You are new to me in redness.

<p>
<cx "property description">  XE "property description"   We can also move the property description to the x1 place of <a href=#e4d3>Example 4.3</a>, producing:

<cx "property abstraction, sumti ellipsis in">  XE "property abstraction(s): sumti ellipsis in"   <cx "property abstraction, specifying determining place by sumti ellipsis">  XE "property abstraction(s): specifying determining place by sumti ellipsis"   There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is “understood” as being specified externally. Thus:

<p>
<ex "property of loving">  XE "property of loving: example“  <pre><a name=e4d5>4.5)	ka mi prami [zo'e] [kei]
	a-property-of me loving something-unspecified
</pre>is quite different from
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d6>4.6)	ka [zo'e] prami mi [kei]
	a-property-of something-unspecified loving me
</pre><p>In particular, sentences like <a href=#e4d7>Example 4.7 </a>and <a href=#e4d8>Example 4.8 </a>are quite different in meaning:
<p>
<ex "love more">  XE "love more: example“  <pre><a name=e4d7>4.7)	la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka mi prami
	John exceeds George in-the property-of (I love X)

Instead, the cmavo “ce'u” of selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form “X” will be used in literal translations.)
<p>
Therefore, an explicit equivalent of <a href=#e4d7>Example 4.7</a>, with no ellipsis, is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d9>4.9)	la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka mi prami ce'u
	John exceeds George in-the property-of (I love X).
</pre>and of <a href=#e4d8>Example 4.8 </a>is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d10>4.10)	la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka ce'u prami mi
	John exceeds George in-the property-of (X loves me).
</pre><p>This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:
<p>
<ex "giving the horse">  XE "giving the horse: example“  <pre><a name=e4d11>4.11)	le ka [zo'e] dunda le xirma [zo'e] [kei]

<pre><a name=e4d12>4.12)	le ka ce'u dunda le xirma [zo'e] [kei]
	the property-of (X is-a-giver of-the horse to someone-unspecified)
	the property of being a giver of the horse
</pre>which is the most natural interpretation of <a href=#e4d11>Example 4.11</a>, versus
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d13>4.13)	le ka [zo'e] dunda le xirma ce'u [kei]
	the property-of (someone-unspecified is-a-giver of-the horse to X)
	the property of being one to whom the horse is given
</pre>which is also a possible interpretation.
<p>
<cx "relationship abstraction">  XE "relationship abstraction"   <cx "property abstractions for relationships">  XE "property abstraction: use of multiple ce’u for relationship abstraction"   It is also possible to have more than one “ce'u” in a “ka” abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction.  Relationship abstractions “package up” a complex relationship for future use; such an abstraction can be translated back into a selbri by placing it in the x2 place of the selbri “bridi”, whose place structure is:
“bridi”: x1 is a predicate relationship with relation x2 (abstraction)
among arguments (sequence/set) x3
<p>
<cx "properties, place structure">  XE "properties: place structure"   The place structure of “ka” abstraction selbri is simply:

<p>
<cx "amount abstraction and mathematics">  XE "amount abstraction and mathematics"   Semantically, a sumti with “le ni” is a number; however, it cannot be treated grammatically as a quantifier in Lojban unless prefixed by the mathematical cmavo “mo'e”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d3>5.3)	li pa vu'u mo'e le ni le pixra cu blanu [kei]
	The-number 1 minus the-operand the amount-of (the picture being-blue)

</pre><p>Mathematical Lojban is beyond the scope of this chapter, and is explained more fully in <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18</a>.
<p>
<cx "amount abstraction, specifying determining place with ce'u">  XE "amount abstraction(s): specifying determining place with ce'u"   <lx "ce'u">  XE "ce'u"   <cx "abstraction, amount contrasted with property">  XE "abstraction(s): amount contrasted with property"   <cx "property abstraction, contrasted with amount abstraction">  XE "property abstraction(s): contrasted with amount abstraction"   There are contexts where either property or amount abstractions make sense, and in such constructions, amount abstractions can make use of “ce'u” just like property abstractors. Thus,
<p>
<ex "blueness varying">  XE "blueness varying: example“  <pre><a name=e5d4>5.4)	le pixra cu cenba le ka ce'u blanu [kei]

<p>
<cx "amount abstraction, scale">  XE "amount abstraction(s): scale"   <cx "amount abstraction, place structure">  XE "amount abstraction(s): place structure"   Whenever we talk of measurement of an amount, there is some sort of scale, and so the place structure of “ni” abstraction selbri is:

</dl><lx "ni">  XE "ni"   <lx "kei">  XE "kei"   <lx "be">  XE "be"   Note: the best way to express the x2 places of abstract sumti is to use something like “le ni <dots>…</dots>kei be”. See <a href=#e9d5>Example 9.5 </a>for the use of this construction.
<p>
Truth-value abstraction: “jei”</h3>
<p><cx "value abstraction">  XE "value abstraction"   <cx "truth-value abstraction">  XE "truth-value abstraction"   <cx "abstraction, truth-value">  XE "abstraction(s): truth-value"   <a name=s6><h3>
<lx "jei">  XE "jei"   <lx "NU">  XE "NU selma’o"   <cx "abstraction, truth-value  contrasted with amount">  XE "abstraction(s): truth-value  contrasted with amount"   The “blueness of the picture” discussed in <a href=#s5>Section 5 </a>refers to the measurable amount of blue pigment (or other source of blueness), not to the degree of truth of the claim that blueness is present. That abstraction is expressed in Lojban using “jei”, which is closely related semantically to “ni”. In the simplest cases, “le jei” produces not a number but a truth value:
<p>
<ex "2 + 2">  XE "2 + 2: example“  <pre><a name=e6d1>6.1)	le jei li re su'i re du li vo [kei]
	the truth-value-of the-number 2 + 2 = the-number 4

	the truth-value-of the-number 2 + 2 = the-number 5
	the truth of 2 + 2 being 5
</pre>is equivalent to “falsehood”.
<p>
However, not everything in life (or even in Lojban) is simply true or false. There are shades of gray even in truth value, and “jei” is Lojban's mechanism for indicating the shade of grey intended:
<p>
<ex "whether criminal">  XE "whether criminal: example“  <pre><a name=e6d3>6.3)	mi ba jdice le jei la djordj. cu zekri gasnu [kei]
	I [future] decide the truth-value of (George being-a-(crime doer)).

</pre><cx "legal system">  XE "legal system"   <cx "truth-value abstraction, place structure">  XE "truth-value abstraction(s): place structure"   <cx "jei, place structure">  XE "jei: place structure"   <a href=#e6d3>Example 6.3 </a>does not imply that George is, or is not, definitely a criminal. Depending on the legal system I am using, I may make some intermediate decision. As a result, “jei” requires an x2 place analogous to that of “ni”:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>jei:  <dd>x1 is the truth value of (the bridi) under epistemology x2
</dl><cx "abstraction, truth-value and fuzzy logic">  XE "abstraction(s): truth-value and fuzzy logic"   <cx "fuzzy logic and truth-value abstraction">  XE "fuzzy logic and truth-value abstraction"   Abstractions using “jei” are the mechanism for fuzzy logic in Lojban; the “jei” abstraction refers to a number between 0 and 1 inclusive (as distinct from “ni” abstractions, which are often on open-ended scales). The detailed conventions for using “jei” in fuzzy-logic contexts have not yet been established.
<p>
Predication/sentence abstraction</h3>
<p><cx "predication abstraction">  XE "predication abstraction"   <cx "sentence abstraction">  XE "sentence abstraction"   <cx "abstraction, predication/sentence">  XE "abstraction(s): predication/sentence"   <a name=s7><h3>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre>	du'u	NU	predication abstraction
</pre><cx "propositional attitudes">  XE "propositional attitudes"   <cx "abstraction, with knowing, believing, etc.">  XE "abstraction(s): with knowing, believing, etc."   <cx "abstraction, mental activity">  XE "abstraction(s): mental activity"   There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call these the “propositional attitudes”, and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:
<p>
<ex "know">  XE "know: example“  <ex "Frank is a fool">  XE "Frank is a fool: example“  <pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	I know that Frank is a fool.
</pre><p>How's that in Lojban? Let us try:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d2>7.2)	mi djuno le nu la frank. cu bebna [kei]
	I know the event of Frank being a fool.
</pre><cx "mental activity">  XE "mental activity"   Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can't be contained inside one's mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like; <a href=#e7d2>Example 7.2 </a>comes close to claiming that Frank's being-a-fool is purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, <a href=#e7d2>Example 7.2 </a>is an instance of improperly marked “sumti raising”, a concept discussed further in <a href=#s10>Section 10</a>).
<p>
Try again:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d3>7.3)	mi djuno le jei la frank. cu bebna [kei]
	I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.
</pre><p>Closer. <a href=#e7d3>Example 7.3 </a>says that I know whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn't say that he is one, as <a href=#e7d1>Example 7.1 </a>does. To catch that nuance, we must say:
<p>
<lx "du'u">  XE "du'u"   <lx "NU">  XE "NU selma’o"   <pre><a name=e7d4>7.4)	mi djuno le du'u la frank. cu bebna [kei]
	I know the predication that Frank is a fool.
</pre><p>Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion “Frank is a fool” is not a property of “le du'u” abstraction, but of “djuno”; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result, “djuno” like “jei” has a place for epistemology, which specifies how we know.) <a href=#e7d5>Example 7.5 </a>has no such implied assertion:
<p>
<cx "curious">  XE "curious"   <ex "curious">  XE "curious: example“  <ex "Frank is a fool">  XE "Frank is a fool: example“  <pre><a name=e7d5>7.5)	mi kucli le du'u la frank. cu bebna [kei]
	I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.
</pre>and here “du'u” could probably be replaced by “jei” without much change in meaning:
<p>
  XE "curious:example"  <pre><a name=e7d6>7.6)	mi kucli le jei la frank. cu bebna [kei]
	I am curious about how true it is that Frank is a fool.
</pre><cx "truth-value abstraction, place structure">  XE "truth-value abstraction(s): place structure"   As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, “du'u” has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:

</dl><cx "linguistic behavior">  XE "linguistic behavior"   <cx "se du'u">  XE "se du'u"   <cx "abstraction, speaking, writing, etc.">  XE "abstraction(s): speaking, writing, etc."   and “le se du'u <dots>…</dots>” is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic behavior regarding bridi:

</pre>because <a href=#e7d8>Example 7.8 </a>claims that John actually said the quoted words, whereas <a href=#e7d7>Example 7.7 </a>claims only that he said some words or other which were to the same purpose.
<p>
<lx "lu'e">  XE "lu'e"   “le se du'u” is much the same as “lu'e le du'u”, a symbol for the predication, but “se du'u” can be used as a selbri, whereas “lu'e” is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See <a href=chap5.html>Chapter 5 </a>for a discussion of “lu'e”.)

Indirect questions</h3>
<p><cx "indirect questions">  XE "indirect questions"   <cx "questions, indirect">  XE "questions: indirect"   <a name=s8><h3>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	kau	UI	indirect question marker
</pre><lx "du'u">  XE "du'u"   There is an alternative type of sentence involving “du'u” and a selbri expressing a propositional attitude. In addition to sentences like
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d1>8.1)	I know that John went to the store.
</pre>we can also say things like
<p>
<ex "know who">  XE "know who: example“  <pre><a name=e8d2>8.2)	I know who went to the store.
</pre><cx "abstraction, with wonder, doubt, etc.">  XE "abstraction(s): with wonder, doubt, etc."   This form is called an “indirect question” in English because the embedded English sentence is a question: “Who went to the store?” A person who says <a href=#e8d2>Example 8.2 </a>is claiming to know the answer to this question. Indirect questions can occur with many other English verbs as well: I can wonder, or doubt, or see, or hear, as well as know who went to the store.
<p>
<lx "kau">  XE "kau"   <lx "UI">  XE "UI selma’o"   To express indirect questions in Lojban, we use a “le du'u” abstraction, but rather than using a question word like “who” (“ma” in Lojban), we use any word that will fit grammatically and mark it with the suffix particle “kau”. This cmavo belongs to selma'o UI, so grammatically it can appear anywhere. The simplest Lojban translation of <a href=#e8d2>Example 8.2 </a>is therefore:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d3>8.3)	mi djuno le du'u makau pu klama le zarci
	I know the predication-of X [indirect question] [past] going to the store.
<cx "kau, “ma kau” contrasted with “la djan. kau”">  XE "kau: ma kau, contrasted with la djan. kau"   <cx "Indirect questions, “ma kau” contrasted with “la djan. kau”">  XE "indirect questions: \“ma kau\” contrasted with \“la djan. kau\”"   <cx "know who, contrasted with know that">  XE "know who: contrasted with know that"   In <a href=#e8d3>Example 8.3</a>, we have chosen to use “ma” as the word marked by “kau”. In fact, any other sumti would have done as well: “zo'e” or “da” or even “la djan.”. Using “la djan.” would suggest that it was John who I knew had gone to the store, however:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d4>8.4)	mi djuno le du'u la djan. kau pu klama 
le zarci
	I know the predication-of/fact-that John [indirect question] [past] going 
to the store.
	I know who went to the store, namely John.
	I know that it was John who went to the store.
</pre><p>Using one of the indefinite pro-sumti such as “ma”, “zo'e”, or “da” does not suggest any particular value.
<p>
Why does Lojban require the “kau” marker, rather than using “ma” as English and Chinese and many other languages do? Because “ma” always signals a direct question, and so
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d5>8.5)	mi djuno le du'u ma pu klama le zarci
	I know the predication-of [what sumti?] [past] goes-to the store
</pre>means
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d6>8.6)	Who is it that I know goes to the store?
</pre><cx "indirect question involving sumti">  XE "indirect question involving sumti"   <cx "indirect questions without “kau”">  XE "indirect questions without \“kau\”"   It is actually not necessary to use “le du'u” and “kau” at all if the indirect question involves a sumti; there is generally a paraphrase of the type:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d7>8.7)	mi djuno fi le pu klama be le zarci
	I know about the [past] goer to-the store.
	I know something about the one who went to the store (namely, his
identity).
</pre>because the x3 place of “djuno” is the subject of knowledge, as opposed to the fact that is known. But when the questioned point is not a sumti, but (say) a logical connection, then there is no good alternative to “kau”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d8>8.8)	mi ba zgana le du'u la djan. 
jikau la djordj. cu zvati le panka
	I [future] observe the predication-of/fact-that John 
[connective indirect question] George is-at the park.
	I will see whether John or George (or both) is at the park.
</pre><p>In addition, <a href=#e8d7>Example 8.7 </a>is only a loose paraphrase of <a href=#e8d3>Example 8.3</a>, because it is left to the listener's insight to realize that what is known about the goer-to-the-store is his identity rather than some other of his attributes.

Lojban sumti raising</h3>
<p><cx "sumti raising">  XE "sumti raising"   <cx "abstraction, simplification to sumti">  XE "abstraction(s): simplification to sumti"   <a name=s10><h3>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
  XE "abstraction conversion"  <pre>	tu'a	LAhE	an abstraction involving
	jai	JAI	abstraction conversion
</pre><cx "abstract description">  XE "abstract description"  It is sometimes inconvenient, in a situation where an abstract description is logically required, to express the abstraction. In English we can say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d1>10.1)	I try to open the door.
</pre>which in Lojban is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d2>10.2)	mi troci le nu [mi] gasnu le nu le vorme cu karbi'o
	I try the event-of (I am-agent-in the event-of (the door open-becomes)).
</pre>which has an abstract description within an abstract description, quite a complex structure. In English (but not in all other languages), we may also say:
<p>
<cx "abstraction, simplification to sumti with tu'a">  XE "abstraction(s): simplification to sumti with tu'a"   <lx "tu'a">  XE "tu'a"   <lx "LAhE">  XE "LAhE selma’o"   <ex "try the door">  XE "try the door: example“  <pre><a name=e10d3>10.3)	I try the door.
</pre>where it is understood that what I try is actually not the door itself, but the act of opening it. The same simplification can be done in Lojban, but it must be marked explicitly using a cmavo. The relevant cmavo is “tu'a”, which belongs to selma'o LAhE. The Lojban equivalent of <a href=#e10d3>Example 10.3 </a>is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d4>10.4)	mi troci tu'a le vorme
	I try some-action-to-do-with the door.
</pre><cx "intermediate abstraction">  XE "intermediate abstraction"   The term “sumti-raising”, as in the title of this section, signifies that a sumti which logically belongs within an abstraction (or even within an abstraction which is itself inside an intermediate abstraction) is “raised” to the main bridi level. This transformation from <a href=#e10d2>Example 10.2 </a>to <a href=#e10d4>Example 10.4 </a>loses information: nothing except convention tells us what the abstraction was.
<p>
Using “tu'a” is a kind of laziness: it makes speaking easier at the possible expense of clarity for the listener. The speaker must be prepared for the listener to respond something like:
<p>
<lx "lu'u">  XE "lu'u"   <lx "LUhU">  XE "LUhU selma’o"   <pre><a name=e10d5>10.5)	tu'a le vorme lu'u ki'a
	something-to-do-with the door [terminator] [confusion!]
</pre>which indicates that “tu'a le vorme” cannot be understood. (The terminator for “tu'a” is “lu'u”, and is used in <a href=#e10d5>Example 10.5 </a>to make clear just what is being questioned: the sumti-raising, rather than the word “vorme” as such.) An example of a confusing raised sumti might be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d6>10.6)	tu'a la djan. cu cafne
	Something-to-do-with John frequently-occurs
</pre><p>This must mean that something which John does, or which happens to John, occurs frequently: but without more context there is no way to figure out what. Note that without the “tu'a”, <a href=#e10d6>Example 10.6 </a>would mean that John considered as an event frequently occurs — in other words, that John has some sort of on-and-off existence! Normally we do not think of people as events in English, but the x1 place of “cafne” is an event, and if something that does not seem to be an event is put there, the Lojbanic listener will attempt to construe it as one. (Of course, this analysis assumes that “djan.” is the name of a person, and not the name of some event.)
<p>
<lx "jai">  XE "jai"   <lx "JAI">  XE "JAI selma’o"   <cx "abstraction, making concrete">  XE "abstraction(s): making concrete"   <cx "abstraction, simplification to sumti with jai">  XE "abstraction(s): simplification to sumti with jai"   Logically, a counterpart of some sort is needed to “tu'a” which transposes an abstract sumti into a concrete one. This is achieved at the selbri level by the cmavo “jai” (of selma'o JAI). This cmavo has more than one function, discussed in <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9 </a>and <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11</a>; for the purposes of this chapter, it operates as a conversion of selbri, similarly to the cmavo of selma'o SE. This conversion changes
<p>
<ex "cause death">  XE "cause death: example“  <pre><a name=e10d7>10.7)	tu'a mi rinka le nu do morsi
	Something-to-do-with me causes the event-of you are-dead
	My action causes your death.
</pre>into
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d8>10.8)	mi jai rinka le nu do morsi
	I am-associated-with causing the event-of your death.
	I cause your death.
</pre><p>In English, the subject of “cause” can either be the actual cause (an event), or else the agent of the cause (a person, typically); not so in Lojban, where the x1 of “rinka” is always an event. <a href=#e10d7>Example 10.7 </a>and <a href=#e10d8>Example 10.8 </a>look equally convenient (or inconvenient), but in making descriptions, <a href=#e10d8>Example 10.8 </a>can be altered to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d9>10.9)	le jai rinka be le nu do morsi
	that-which-is associated-with causing (the event-of your death)
	the one who caused your death
</pre>because “jai” modifies the selbri and can be incorporated into the description — not so for “tu'a”.
<p>
The weakness of “jai” used in descriptions in this way is that it does not specify which argument of the implicit abstraction is being raised into the x1 place of the description selbri. One can be more specific by using the modal form of “jai” explained in <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d10>10.10)	le jai gau rinka be le nu do morsi
	that-which-is agent-in causing (the event-of your death)
Event-type abstractors and event contour tenses</h3>

This section is a logical continuation of <a href=#s3>Section 3</a>.
<p>
<lx "NU">  XE "NU selma’o"   <lx "ZAhO">  XE "ZAhO selma’o"   There exists a relationship between the four types of events explained in <a href=#s3>Section 3 </a>and the event contour tense cmavo of selma'o ZAhO. The specific cmavo of NU and of ZAhO are mutually interdefining; the ZAhO contours were chosen to fit the needs of the NU event types and vice versa. Event contours are explained in full in <a href=chap10.html>Chapter 10</a>, and only summarized here.
<p>
The purpose of ZAhO cmavo is to represent the natural portions of an event, such as the beginning, the middle, and the end. They fall into several groups:
<p>
<cx "process abstraction, related tense contours">  XE "process abstraction(s): related tense contours"   <dl compact><dt><dd>The cmavo “pu'o”, “ca'o”, and “ba'o” represent spans of time: before an event begins, while it is going on, and after it is over, respectively.
<p><dt><dd>The cmavo “co'a”, “de'a”, “di'a”, and “co'u” represent points of time: the start of an event, the temporary stopping of an event, the resumption of an event after a stop, and the end of an event, respectively. Not all events can have breaks in them, in which case “de'a” and “di'a” do not apply.
<p><dt><dd>The cmavo “mo'u” and “za'o” correspond to “co'u” and “ba'o” respectively, in the case of those events which have a natural ending point that may not be the same as the actual ending point: “mo'u” refers to the natural ending point, and “za'o” to the time between the natural ending point and the actual ending point (the “excessive” or “superfective” part of the event).
<p><dt><dd>The cmavo “co'i” represents an entire event considered as a point-event or achievement.
</dl><lx "pu'u">  XE "pu'u"   All these cmavo are applicable to events seen as processes and abstracted with “pu'u”. Only processes have enough internal structure to make all these points and spans of time meaningful.
<p>
<cx "state abstraction, related tense contours">  XE "state abstraction(s): related tense contours"   <lx "za'i">  XE "za'i"   For events seen as states and abstracted with “za'i”, the meaningful event contours are the spans “pu'o”, “ca'o”, and “ba'o”; the starting and ending points “co'a” and “co'u”, and the achievement contour “co'i”. States do not have natural endings distinct from their actual endings. (It is an open question whether states can be stopped and resumed.)
<p>
<cx "activity abstraction, related tense contours">  XE "activity abstraction(s): related tense contours"   <lx "zu'o">  XE "zu'o"   For events seen as activities and abstracted with “zu'o”, the meaningful event contours are the spans “pu'o”, “ca'o”, and “ba'o”, and the achievement contour “co'i”. Because activities are inherently cyclic and repetitive, the beginning and ending points are not well-defined: you do not know whether an activity has truly begun until it begins to repeat.
<p>
<cx "point-event abstraction, related tense contours">  XE "point-event abstraction(s): related tense contours"   <cx "achievement abstraction, related tense contours">  XE "achievement abstraction(s): related tense contours"   For events seen as point-events and abstracted with “mu'e”, the meaningful event contours are the spans “pu'o” and “ba'o” but not “ca'o” (a point-event has no duration), and the achievement contour “co'i”.
<p>
Note that the parts of events are themselves events, and may be treated as such. The points in time may be seen as “mu'e” point-events; the spans of time may constitute processes or activities. Therefore, Lojban allows us to refer to processes within processes, activities within states, and many other complicated abstract things.
<p>
Abstractor connection</h3>
<p><cx "abstractions, connection">  XE "abstraction(s): connection"   <cx "connectives, for abstractions">  XE "connectives: for abstractions"   <a name=s12><h3>
An abstractor may be replaced by two or more abstractors joined by logical or non-logical connectives. Connectives are explained in detail in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>. The connection can be expanded to one between two bridi which differ only in abstraction marker. <a href=#e13d1>Example 13.1 </a>and <a href=#e13d2>Example 13.2 </a>are equivalent in meaning:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d1>13.1)	le ka la frank. ciska cu xlali

<a name=e13d2>13.2)	le ka je ni la frank. ciska cu xlali
	The quality and quantity of Frank's writing is bad.

The following table gives each abstractor, an English gloss for it, a Lojban gismu which is connected with it (more or less remotely: the associations between abstractors and gismu are meant more as memory hooks than for any kind of inference), the rafsi associated with it, and (on the following line) its place structure.

Dog House And White House: Determining lujvo Place Structures</h2>
<h6>$Revision: 4.0 $<br>
mkhtml: 1.1</h6></p></center>
Why have lujvo?</h3>
<p><cx "lujvo, place structure of">  XE "lujvo: place structure of"   <a name=s1><h3>
<cx "world's languages">  XE "world's languages"   <cx "word lists">  XE "word lists"   <cx "semantic primitives">  XE "semantic primitives"   <cx "minimal list">  XE "minimal list"   <cx "gismu, rationale for">  XE "gismu: rationale for"   <cx "lujvo, grammar of">  XE "lujvo: grammar of"   <cx "compound words">  XE "compound words"   The Lojban vocabulary is founded on its list of 1350-plus gismu, made up by combining word lists from various sources. These gismu are not intended to be either a complete vocabulary for the language nor a minimal list of semantic primitives. Instead, the gismu list serves as a basis for the creation of compound words, or lujvo. The intention is that (except in certain semantically broad but shallow fields such as cultures, nations, foods, plants, and animals) suitable lujvo can be devised to cover the ten million or so concepts expressible in all the world's languages taken together. Grammatically, lujvo behave just like gismu: they have place structures and function as selbri.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, compared with tanru">  XE "lujvo: compared with tanru"   There is a close relationship between lujvo and tanru. In fact, lujvo are condensed forms of tanru:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	ti fagri festi
	That is-fire waste.
</pre>contains a tanru which can be reduced to the lujvo in:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d2>1.2)	ti fagyfesti
	That is-fire-waste.
	That is-ashes.
</pre><p>Although the lujvo “fagyfesti” is derived from the tanru “fagri festi”, it is not equivalent in meaning to it. In particular, “fagyfesti” has a distinct place structure of its own, not the same as that of “festi”. (In contrast, the tanru does have the same place structure as “festi”.) The lujvo needs to take account of the places of “fagri” as well. When a tanru is made into a lujvo, there is no equivalent of “be <dots>…</dots>bei <dots>…</dots>be'o” (described in <a href=chap5.html>Chapter 5</a>) to incorporate sumti into the middle of the lujvo.
<p>
<cx "creative understanding">  XE "creative understanding"   <cx "lujvo, rationale for">  XE "lujvo: rationale for"   So why have lujvo? Primarily to reduce semantic ambiguity. On hearing a tanru, there is a burden on the listener to figure out what the tanru might mean. Adding further terms to the tanru reduces ambiguity in one sense, by providing more information; but it increases ambiguity in another sense, because there are more and more tanru joints, each with an ambiguous significance. Since lujvo, like other brivla, have a fixed place structure and a single meaning, encapsulating a commonly-used tanru into a lujvo relieves the listener of the burden of creative understanding. In addition, lujvo are typically shorter than the corresponding tanru.
<p>
<cx "alternative guidelines">  XE "alternative guidelines"   <cx "absolute laws">  XE "absolute laws"   <cx "lujvo, guidelines for place structure">  XE "lujvo: guidelines for place structure"   <cx "lujvo place structure, guidelines">  XE "lujvo place structure: guidelines"   There are no absolute laws fixing the place structure of a newly created lujvo. The maker must consider the place structures of all the components of the tanru and then decide which are still relevant and which can be removed. What is said in this chapter represents guidelines, presented as one possible standard, not necessarily complete, and not the only possible standard. There may well be lujvo that are built without regard for these guidelines, or in accordance with entirely different guidelines, should such alternative guidelines someday be developed. The reason for presenting any guidelines at all is so that Lojbanists have a starting point for deciding on a likely place structure — one that others seeing the same word can also arrive at by similar consideration.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, cmavo incorporation">  XE "lujvo: cmavo incorporation"   If the tanru includes connective cmavo such as “bo”, “ke”, “ke'e”, or “je”, or conversion or abstraction cmavo such as “se” or “nu”, there are ways of incorporating them into the lujvo as well. Sometimes this makes the lujvo excessively long; if so, the cmavo may be dropped. This leads to the possibility that more than one tanru could produce the same lujvo. Typically, however, only one of the possible tanru is useful enough to justify making a lujvo for it.
<p>
The exact workings of the lujvo-making algorithm, which takes a tanru built from gismu (and possibly cmavo) and produces a lujvo from it, are described in <a href=chap4.html>Chapter 4</a>.
<p>
The meaning of tanru: a necessary detour</h3>
<p><cx "necessary detour">  XE "necessary detour"   <a name=s2><h3>
<cx "lujvo meaning">  XE "lujvo meaning"   <cx "veljvo, definition">  XE "veljvo: definition"   <cx "seltau, definition">  XE "seltau: definition"   <cx "tertau, definition">  XE "tertau: definition"   <cx "modifier, of a tanru">  XE "modifier: of a tanru"   <cx "modified, of a tanru">  XE "modified: of a tanru"   The meaning of a lujvo is controlled by — but is not the same as — the meaning of the tanru from which the lujvo was constructed. The tanru corresponding to a lujvo is called its “veljvo” in Lojban, and since there is no concise English equivalent, that term will be used in this chapter. Furthermore, the left (modifier) part of a tanru will be called the “seltau”, and the right (modified) part the “tertau”, following the usage of <a href=chap5.html>Chapter 5</a>. For brevity, we will speak of the seltau or tertau of a lujvo, meaning of course the seltau or tertau of the veljvo of that lujvo. (If this terminology is confusing, substituting “modifier” for “seltau” and “modified” for “tertau” may help.)
<p>
<cx "tanru, place structure of">  XE "tanru: place structure of"   The place structure of a tanru is always the same as the place structure of its tertau. As a result, the meaning of the tanru is a modified version of the meaning of the tertau; the tanru will typically, but not always, refer to a subset of the things referred to by the tertau.
<p>
<cx "wine-dark sea">  XE "wine-dark sea"   <cx "tanru, purpose">  XE "tanru: purpose"   The purpose of a tanru is to join concepts together without necessarily focusing on the exact meaning of the seltau. For example, in the <cite>Iliad</cite>, the poet talks about “the wine-dark sea”, in which “wine” is a seltau relative to “dark”, and the pair of words is a seltau relative to “sea”. We're talking about the sea, not about wine or color. The other words are there to paint a scene in the listener's mind, in which the real action will occur, and to evoke relations to other sagas of the time similarly describing the sea. Logical inferences about wine or color will be rejected as irrelevant.
<p>
<ex "goer-house">  XE "goer-house: example“  As a simple example, consider the rather non-obvious tanru “klama zdani”, or “goer-house”. The gismu “zdani” has two places:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	x1 is a nest/house/lair/den for inhabitant x2
</pre>(but in this chapter we will use simply “house”, for brevity), and the gismu “klama” has five:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d2>2.2)	x1 goes to destination x2 from origin point x3 via route x4 using means x5
</pre><p>The tanru “klama zdani” will also have two places, namely those of “zdani”. Since a “klama zdani” is a type of “zdani”, we can assume that all goer-houses — whatever they may be — are also houses.
<p>
<cx "fleas">  XE "fleas"   <ex "dog house">  XE "dog house: example“  <cx "tanru, possible meanings of">  XE "tanru: possible meanings of"   But is knowing the places of the tertau everything that is needed to understand the meaning of a tanru? No. To see why, let us switch to a less unlikely tanru: “gerku zdani”, literally “dog house”. A tanru expresses a very loose relation: a “gerku zdani” is a house that has something to do with some dog or dogs. What the precise relation might be is left unstated. Thus, the meaning of “lo gerku zdani” can include all of the following: houses occupied by dogs, houses shaped by dogs, dogs which are also houses (e.g. houses for fleas), houses named after dogs, and so on. All that is essential is that the place structure of “zdani” continues to apply.
<p>
For something (call it z1) to qualify as a “gerku zdani” in Lojban, it's got to be a house, first of all. For it to be a house, it's got to house someone (call that z2). Furthermore, there's got to be a dog somewhere (called g1). For g1 to count as a dog in Lojban, it's got to belong to some breed as well (called g2). And finally, for z1 to be in the first place of “gerku zdani”, as opposed to just “zdani”, there's got to be some relationship (called r) between some place of “zdani” and some place of “gerku”. It doesn't matter which places, because if there's a relationship between some place of “zdani” and any place of “gerku”, then that relationship can be compounded with the relationship between the places of “gerku” — namely, “gerku” itself — to reach any of the other “gerku” places. Thus, if the relationship turns out to be between z2 and g2, we can still state r in terms of z1 and g1: “the relationship involves the dog g1, whose breed has to do with the occupant of the house z1”.
<p>
<ex "Bill Clinton">  XE "Bill Clinton: example“  Doubtless to the relief of the reader, here's an illustration. We want to find out whether the White House (the one in which the U. S. President lives, that is) counts as a “gerku zdani”. We go through the five variables. The White House is the z1. It houses Bill Clinton as z2, as of this writing, so it counts as a “zdani”. Let's take a dog — say, Spot (g1). Spot has to have a breed; let's say it's a Saint Bernard (g2). Now, the White House counts as a “gerku zdani” if there is any relationship (r) at all between the White House and Spot. (We'll choose the g1 and z1 places to relate by r; we could have chosen any other pair of places, and simply gotten a different relationship.)
<p>
<cx "Chelsea Clinton">  XE "Chelsea Clinton"   The sky is the limit for r; it can be as complicated as “The other day, g1 (Spot) chased Socks, who is owned by Chelsea Clinton, who is the daughter of Bill Clinton, who lives in z1 (the White House)” or even worse. If no such r can be found, well, you take another dog, and keep going until no more dogs can be found. Only then can we say that the White House cannot fit into the first place of “gerku zdani”.
<p>
As we have seen, no less than five elements are involved in the definition of “gerku zdani”: the house, the house dweller, the dog, the dog breed (everywhere a dog goes in Lojban, a dog breed follows), and the relationship between the house and the dog. Since tanru are explicitly ambiguous in Lojban, the relationship r cannot be expressed within a tanru (if it could, it wouldn't be a tanru any more!) All the other places, however, can be expressed — thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d3>2.3)	la blabi zdani cu gerku be fa la spot. bei la sankt. berNARD. be'o
		zdani la bil. klinton.
	The White House is-a-dog (namely Spot of-breed Saint Bernard)
		type-of-house-for Bill Clinton.
</pre><cx "derogatory terms">  XE "derogatory terms"   Not the most elegant sentence ever written in either Lojban or English. Yet if there is any relation at all between Spot and the White House, <a href=#e2d4>Example 2.4 </a>is arguably true. If we concentrate on just one type of relation in interpreting the tanru “gerku zdani”, then the meaning of “gerku zdani” changes. So if we understand “gerku zdani” as having the same meaning as the English word “doghouse”, the White House would no longer be a “gerku zdani” with respect to Spot, because as far as we know Spot does not actually live in the White House, and the White House is not a doghouse (derogatory terms for incumbents notwithstanding).
<p>
<a name=s3><h3>The meaning of lujvo</h3>
<p>
This is a fairly long way to go to try and work out how to say “doghouse”! The reader can take heart; we're nearly there. Recall that one of the components involved in fixing the meaning of a tanru — the one left deliberately vague — is the precise relation between the tertau and the seltau. Indeed, fixing this relation is tantamount to giving an interpretation to the ambiguous tanru.
<p>
<cx "disambiguated instance">  XE "disambiguated instance"   <cx "lujvo, interpreting">  XE "lujvo: interpreting"   <cx "lujvo, and seltau/tertau relationship">  XE "lujvo: and seltau/tertau relationship"   A lujvo is defined by a single disambiguated instance of a tanru. That is to say, when we try to design the place structure of a lujvo, we don't need to try to discover the relation between the tertau and the seltau. We already know what kind of relation we're looking for; it's given by the specific need we wish to express, and it determines the place structure of the lujvo itself.
<p>
Therefore, it is generally not appropriate to simply devise lujvo and decide on place structures for them without considering one or more specific usages for the coinage. If one does not consider specifics, one will be likely to make erroneous generalizations on the relationship r.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, design consideration for relationship">  XE "lujvo: design consideration for relationship"   The insight driving the rest of this chapter is this: while the relation expressed by a tanru can be very distant (e.g. Spot chasing Socks, above), the relationship singled out for disambiguation in a lujvo should be quite close. This is because lujvo-making, paralleling natural language compounding, picks out the most salient relationship r between a tertau place and a seltau place to be expressed in a single word. The relationship “dog chases cat owned by daughter of person living in house” is too distant, and too incidental, to be likely to need expression as a single short word; the relationship “dog lives in house” is not. From all the various interpretations of “gerku zdani”, the person creating “gerzda” should pick the most useful value of r. The most useful one is usually going to be the most obvious one, and the most obvious one is usually the closest one.
<p>
In fact, the relationship will almost always be so close that the predicate expressing r will be either the seltau or the tertau predicate itself. This should come as no surprise, given that a word like “zdani” in Lojban is a predicate. Predicates express relations; so when you're looking for a relation to tie together “le zdani” and “le gerku”, the most obvious relation to pick is the very relation named by the tertau, “zdani”: the relation between a home and its dweller. As a result, the object which fills the first place of “gerku” (the dog) also fills the second place of “zdani” (the house-dweller).
<p>
<cx "lujvo place structure, dropping redundant places">  XE "lujvo place structure: dropping redundant places"   The seltau-tertau relationship in the veljvo is expressed by the seltau or tertau predicate itself. Therefore, at least one of the seltau places is going to be equivalent to a tertau place. This place is thus redundant, and can be dropped from the place structure of the lujvo. As a corollary, the precise relationship between the veljvo components can be implicitly determined by finding one or more places to overlap in this way.
<p>
So what is the place structure of “gerzda”? We're left with three places, since the dweller, the “se zdani”, turned out to be identical to the dog, the “gerku”. We can proceed as follows:
<p>
<cx "lujvo place structure, notation conventions">  XE "lujvo place structure: notation conventions"   (The notation introduced casually in <a href=#s2>Section 2 </a>will be useful in the rest of this chapter. Rather than using the regular x1, x2, etc. to represent places, we'll use the first letter of the relevant gismu in place of the “x”, or more than one letter where necessary to resolve ambiguities. Thus, z1 is the first place of “zdani”, and g2 is the second place of “gerku”.)
<p>
<cx "new notation">  XE "new notation"   <cx "lujvo place structure, explicated walk-through">  XE "lujvo place structure: explicated walk-through"   The place structure of “zdani” is given as <a href=#e2d1>Example 2.1</a>, but is repeated here using the new notation:

<pre><a name=e3d3>3.3)	z1 is a house for dweller z2 of breed g2
</pre>which can also be written
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d4>3.4)	z1 is a house for dog g1 of breed g2
</pre>or more comprehensively
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d5>3.5)	z1 is a house for dweller/dog z2=g1 of breed g2
</pre><p>Despite the apparently conclusive nature of <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5</a>, our task is not yet done: we still need to decide whether any of the remaining places should also be eliminated, and what order the lujvo places should appear in. These concerns will be addressed in the remainder of the chapter; but we are now equipped with the terminology needed for those discussions.
<p>
<a name=s4><h3>Selecting places</h3>
<p>
<cx "lujvo place structure, basis of">  XE "lujvo place structure: basis of"   The set of places of an ordinary lujvo are selected from the places of its component gismu. More precisely, the places of such a lujvo are derived from the set of places of the component gismu by eliminating unnecessary places, until just enough places remain to give an appropriate meaning to the lujvo. In general, including a place makes the concept expressed by a lujvo more general; excluding a place makes the concept more specific, because omitting the place requires assuming a standard value or range of values for it.
<p>
<cx "lujvo place structure, rationale for standardization">  XE "lujvo place structure: rationale for standardization"   It would be possible to design the place structure of a lujvo from scratch, treating it as if it were a gismu, and working out what arguments contribute to the notion to be expressed by the lujvo. There are two reasons arguing against doing so and in favor of the procedure detailed in this chapter.
<p>
The first is that it might be very difficult for a hearer or reader, who has no preconceived idea of what concept the lujvo is intended to convey, to work out what the place structure actually is. Instead, he or she would have to make use of a lujvo dictionary every time a lujvo is encountered in order to work out what a “se jbopli” or a “te klagau” is. But this would mean that, rather than having to learn just the 1300-odd gismu place structures, a Lojbanist would also have to learn myriads of lujvo place structures with little or no apparent pattern or regularity to them. The purpose of the guidelines documented in this chapter is to apply regularity and to make it conventional wherever possible.
<p>
The second reason is related to the first: if the veljvo of the lujvo has not been properly selected, and the places for the lujvo are formulated from scratch, then there is a risk that some of the places formulated may not correspond to any of the places of the gismu used in the veljvo of the lujvo. If that is the case — that is to say, if the lujvo places are not a subset of the veljvo gismu places — then it will be very difficult for the hearer or reader to understand what a particular place means, and what it is doing in that particular lujvo. This is a topic that will be further discussed in <a href=#s14>Section 14</a>.
<p>
However, second-guessing the place structure of the lujvo is useful in guiding the process of subsequently eliminating places from the veljvo. If the Lojbanist has an idea of what the final place structure should look like, he or she should be able to pick an appropriate veljvo to begin with, in order to express the idea, and then to decide which places are relevant or not relevant to expressing that idea.
<p>
<a name=s5><h3>Symmetrical and asymmetrical lujvo</h3>
<p>
<cx "lujvo, symmetrical">  XE "lujvo: symmetrical"   <cx "veljvo, symmetrical">  XE "veljvo: symmetrical"   <ex "great soldier">  XE "great soldier: example“  <cx "lujvo place structure, when first places redundant">  XE "lujvo place structure: when first places redundant"   A common pattern, perhaps the most common pattern, of lujvo-making creates what is called a “symmetrical lujvo”. A symmetrical lujvo is one based on a tanru interpretation such that the first place of the seltau is equivalent to the first place of the tertau: each component of the tanru characterizes the same object. As an illustration of this, consider the lujvo “balsoi”: it is intended to mean “both great and a soldier” — that is, “great soldier”, which is the interpretation we would tend to give its veljvo, “banli sonci”. The underlying gismu place structures are:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	“banli”:  b1 is great in property b2 by standard b3
	“sonci”:  s1 is a soldier of army s2
</pre><p>In this case the s1 place of “sonci” is redundant, since it is equivalent to the b1 place of “banli”. Therefore the place structure of “balsoi” need not include places for both s1 and b1, as they refer to the same thing. So the place structure of “balsoi” is at most
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d2>5.2)	b1=s1 is a great soldier of army s2 in property b2 by standard b3
</pre><cx "symmetrical veljvo">  XE "symmetrical veljvo"   <ex "listen attentively">  XE "listen attentively: example“  <cx "lujvo place structure, when first places redundant plus others">  XE "lujvo place structure: when first places redundant plus others"   Some symmetrical veljvo have further equivalent places in addition to the respective first places. Consider the lujvo “tinju'i”, “to listen” (“to hear attentively, to hear and pay attention”). The place structures of the gismu “tirna” and “jundi” are:
<p>
<cx "background noise">  XE "background noise"   <pre><a name=e5d3>5.3)	“tirna”:  t1 hears sound t2 against background noise t3
	“jundi”:  j1 pays attention to j2
</pre>and the place structure of the lujvo is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d4>5.4)	j1=t1 listens to j2=t2 against background noise t3
</pre><p>Why so? Because not only is the j1 place (the one who pays attention) equivalent to the t1 place (the hearer), but the j2 place (the thing paid attention to) is equivalent to the t2 place (the thing heard).
<p>
<cx "lujvo, asymmetrical">  XE "lujvo: asymmetrical"   <cx "lujvo place structure, when first place redundant with non-first">  XE "lujvo place structure: when first place redundant with non-first"   A substantial minority of lujvo have the property that the first place of the seltau (“gerku” in this case) is equivalent to a place other than the first place of the tertau; such lujvo are said to be “asymmetrical”. (There is a deliberate parallel here with the terms “asymmetrical tanru” and “symmetrical tanru” used in <a href=chap5.html>Chapter 5</a>.)
<p>
<cx "lujvo place structure, effect of “SE”">  XE "lujvo place structure: effect of SE"   In principle any asymmetrical lujvo could be expressed as a symmetrical lujvo. Consider “gerzda”, discussed in <a href=#s3>Section 3</a>, where we learned that the g1 place was equivalent to the z2 place. In order to get the places aligned, we could convert “zdani” to “se zdani” (or “selzda” when expressed as a lujvo). The place structure of “selzda” is
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d5>5.5)	s1 is housed by nest s2
</pre>and so the three-part lujvo “gerselzda” would have the place structure
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d6>5.6)	s1=g1 is a dog housed in nest s2 of dog breed g2
</pre><p>However, although “gerselzda” is a valid lujvo, it doesn't translate “doghouse”; its first place is the dog, not the doghouse. Furthermore, it is more complicated than necessary; “gerzda” is simpler than “gerselzda”.
<p>
From the reader's or listener's point of view, it may not always be obvious whether a newly met lujvo is symmetrical or asymmetrical, and if the latter, what kind of asymmetrical lujvo. If the place structure of the lujvo isn't given in a dictionary or elsewhere, then plausibility must be applied, just as in interpreting tanru.
<p>
<ex "car goer">  XE "car goer: example“  The lujvo “karcykla”, for example, is based on “karce klama”, or “car goer”. The place structure of “karce” is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d7>5.7)	karce:  ka1 is a car carrying ka2 propelled by ka3
</pre><p>An asymmetrical interpretation of “karcykla” that is strictly analogous to the place structure of “gerzda”, equating the kl2 (destination) and ka1 (car) places, would lead to the place structure
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d8>5.8)	kl1 goes to car kl2=ka1 which carries ka2 propelled by ka3 from origin kl3
		via route kl4 by means of kl5
</pre><p>But in general we go about in cars, rather than going to cars, so a far more likely place structure treats the ka1 place as equivalent to the kl5 place, leading to
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d9>5.9)	kl1 goes to destination kl2 from origin kl3 via route kl4 
by means of car kl5=ka1 carrying ka2 propelled by ka3.
</pre>instead.
<p>
<a name=s6><h3>Dependent places</h3>
<p>
<cx "lujvo place structure, dependent places">  XE "lujvo place structure: dependent places"   In order to understand which places, if any, should be completely removed from a lujvo place structure, we need to understand the concept of dependent places. One place of a brivla is said to be dependent on another if its value can be predicted from the values of one or more of the other places. For example, the g2 place of “gerku” is dependent on the g1 place. Why? Because when we know what fits in the g1 place (Spot, let us say, a well-known dog), then we know what fits in the g2 place (“St. Bernard”, let us say). In other words, when the value of the g1 place has been specified, the value of the g2 place is determined by it. Conversely, since each dog has only one breed, but each breed contains many dogs, the g1 place is not dependent on the g2 place; if we know only that some dog is a St. Bernard, we cannot tell by that fact alone which dog is meant.
<p>
For “zdani”, on the other hand, there is no dependency between the places. When we know the identity of a house-dweller, we have not determined the house, because a dweller may dwell in more than one house. By the same token, when we know the identity of a house, we do not know the identity of its dweller, for a house may contain more than one dweller.
<p>
<cx "lujvo place structure, dropping dependent seltau places">  XE "lujvo place structure: dropping dependent seltau places"   The rule for eliminating places from a lujvo is that dependent places provided by the seltau are eliminated. Therefore, in “gerzda” the dependent g2 place is removed from the tentative place structure given in <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5</a>, leaving the place structure:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d1>6.1)	z1 is the house dwelt in by dog z2=g1
</pre><p>Informally put, the reason this has happened — and it happens a lot with seltau places — is that the third place was describing not the doghouse, but the dog who lives in it. The sentence
<p>
<ex "Mon Repos">  XE "Mon Repos: example“  <pre><a name=e6d2>6.2)	la mon. rePOS. gerzda la spat.
	Mon Repos is a doghouse of Spot.
</pre>really means
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d3>6.3)	la mon. rePOS. zdani la spat. noi gerku
	Mon Repos is a house of Spot, who is a dog.
</pre>since that is the interpretation we have given “gerzda”. But that in turn means
<p>
  XE "unspecified breed:example"  <pre><a name=e6d4>6.4)	la mon. rePOS. zdani la spat noi ke'a gerku zo'e
	Mon Repos is a house of Spot, who is a dog of unspecified breed.
</pre><p>Specifically,

	Mon Repos is a house of Spot, who is a dog of breed St. Bernard.
</pre>and in that case, it makes little sense to say
<p>

</pre><cx "supplementary information">  XE "supplementary information"   employing the over-ample place structure of <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5</a>. The dog breed is redundantly given both in the main selbri and in the relative clause, and (intuitively speaking) is repeated in the wrong place, since the dog breed is supplementary information about the dog, and not about the doghouse.
<p>
<ex "beetle">  XE "beetle: example“  As a further example, take “cakcinki”, the lujvo for “beetle”, based on the tanru “calku cinki”, or “shell-insect”. The gismu place structures are:

The ca3 place is dependent on ci1, because all insects (which fit into ci1) have shells made of chitin (which fits into ca3). Furthermore, ca1 is dependent on ci1 as well, because each insect has only a single shell. And since ca2 (the thing with the shell) is equivalent to ci1 (the insect), the place structure is
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d8>6.8)	ci1=ca2 is a beetle of species ci2
</pre>with not a single place of “calku” surviving independently!
<p>
<cx "Coleoptera">  XE "Coleoptera"   <cx "beetles">  XE "beetles"   (Note that there is nothing in this explanation that tells us just why “cakcinki” means “beetle” (member of Coleoptera), since all insects in their adult forms have chitin shells of some sort. The answer, which is in no way predictable, is that the shell is a prominent, highly noticeable feature of beetles in particular.)
<p>
<cx "lujvo place structure, dropping dependent tertau places">  XE "lujvo place structure: dropping dependent tertau places"   What about the dependency of ci2 on ci1? After all, no beetle belongs to more than one species, so it would seem that the ci2 place of “cakcinki” could be eliminated on the same reasoning that allowed us to eliminate the g2 place of “gerzda” above. However, it is a rule that dependent places are not eliminated from a lujvo when they are derived from the tertau of its veljvo. This rule is imposed to keep the place structures of lujvo from drifting too far from the tertau place structure; if a place is necessary in the tertau, it's treated as necessary in the lujvo as well.
<p>
<cx "wrong concept">  XE "wrong concept"   <cx "shoehorn">  XE "shoehorn"   <cx "lujvo place structure, selecting tertau">  XE "lujvo place structure: selecting tertau"   In general, the desire to remove places coming from the tertau is a sign that the veljvo selected is simply wrong. Different place structures imply different concepts, and the lujvo maker may be trying to shoehorn the wrong concept into the place structure of his or her choosing. This is obvious when someone tries to shoe-horn a “klama” tertau into a “litru” or “cliva” concept, for example: these gismu differ in their number of arguments, and suppressing places of “klama” in a lujvo doesn't make any sense if the resulting modified place structure is that of “litru” or “cliva”.
<p>
Sometimes the dependency is between a single place of the tertau and the whole event described by the seltau. Such cases are discussed further in <a href=#s13>Section 13</a>.

It doesn't matter much to a doghouse what breed of dog inhabits it, but it can make quite a lot of difference to the construction of a school building what kind of school is in it! Music schools need auditoriums and recital rooms, elementary schools need playgrounds, and so on: therefore, the place structure of “kuldi'u” (from “ckule dinju”, and meaning “school building”) needs to be
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d9>6.9)	d1 is a building housing school c1 teaching subject c3 to audience c4
</pre>even though c3 and c4 are plainly dependent on c1. The other places of “ckule”, the location (c2) and operators (c5), don't seem to be necessary to the concept “school building”, and are dependent on c1 to boot, so they are omitted. Again, the need for case-by-case consideration of place structures is demonstrated.

<a name=s7><h3>Ordering lujvo places</h3>
<p>
<cx "lujvo place order">  XE "lujvo place order"   So far, we have concentrated on selecting the places to go into the place structure of a lujvo. However, this is only half the story. In using selbri in Lojban, it is important to remember the right order of the sumti. With lujvo, the need to attend to the order of sumti becomes critical: the set of places selected should be ordered in such a way that a reader unfamiliar with the lujvo should be able to tell which place is which.
<p>
<cx "lujvo place order, rationale for standardization">  XE "lujvo place order: rationale for standardization"   <ex "prayer">  XE "prayer: example“  If we aim to make understandable lujvo, then, we should make the order of places in the place structure follow some conventions. If this does not occur, very real ambiguities can turn up. Take for example the lujvo “jdaselsku”, meaning “prayer”. In the sentence
<p>
  XE "Dong: example"  <pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	di'e jdaselsku la dong.
	This-utterance is-a-prayer somehow-related-to-Dong.

<pre><a name=e7d3>7.3)	This is a prayer to Dong.
</pre><p>We could resolve such problems on a case-by-case basis for each lujvo (<a href=#s14>Section 14 </a>discusses when this is actually necessary), but case-by-case resolution for run-of-the-mill lujvo makes the task of learning lujvo place structures unmanageable. People need consistent patterns to make sense of what they learn. Such patterns can be found across gismu place structures (see <a href=#s16>Section 16</a>), and are even more necessary in lujvo place structures. Case-by-case consideration is still necessary; lujvo creation is a subtle art, after all. But it is helpful to take advantage of any available regularities.

<cx "elimination process">  XE "elimination process"   <cx "lujvo place order, symmetrical lujvo">  XE "lujvo place order: symmetrical lujvo"   <ex "great soldier">  XE "great soldier: example“  We use two different ordering rules: one for symmetrical lujvo and one for asymmetrical ones. A symmetrical lujvo like “balsoi” (from <a href=#s5>Section 5</a>) has the places of its tertau followed by whatever places of the seltau survive the elimination process. For “balsoi”, the surviving places of “banli” are b2 and b3, leading to the place structure:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d4>7.4)	b1=s1 is a great soldier of army s2 in property b2 by standard b3
</pre>just what appears in <a href=#e5d1>Example 5.1</a>. In fact, all place structures shown until now have been in the correct order by the conventions of this section, though the fact has been left tacit until now.
<p>
The motivation for this rule is the parallelism between the lujvo bridi-schema

The seltau places are inserted not at the end of the place structure, but rather immediately after the tertau place which is equivalent to the first place of the seltau. Consider “dalmikce”, meaning “veterinarian”: its veljvo is “danlu mikce”, or “animal doctor”. The place structures for those gismu are:

<p>
<cx "lujvo place order, based on 3-or-more part veljvo">  XE "lujvo place order: based on 3-or-more part veljvo"   <ex "tomorrow">  XE "tomorrow: example“  The theory we have outlined so far is an account of lujvo with two parts. But often lujvo are made containing more than two parts. An example is “bavlamdei”, “tomorrow”: it is composed of the rafsi for “future”, “adjacent”, and “day”. How does the account we have given apply to lujvo like this?
<p>
The best way to approach such lujvo is to continue to classify them as based on binary tanru, the only difference being that the seltau or the tertau or both is itself a lujvo. So it is easiest to make sense of “bavlamdei” as having two components: “bavla'i”, “next”, and “djedi”. If we know or invent the lujvo place structure for the components, we can compose the new lujvo place structure in the usual way.
<p>
In this case, “bavla'i” is given the place structure
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d1>8.1)	b1=l1 is next after b2=l2

</pre><cx "anomalous ordering of lujvo places">  XE "anomalous ordering of lujvo places"   While symmetrical lujvo normally put any trailing tertau places before any seltau places, the day standard is a much less important concept than the day the tomorrow follows, in the definition of “bavlamdei”. This is an example of how the guidelines presented for selecting and ordering lujvo places are just that, not laws that must be rigidly adhered to. In this case, we choose to rank places in order of relative importance. The resulting place structure is:

</pre><cx "sword blade">  XE "sword blade"   Since “cladakyxa'i” is a symmetrical lujvo based on “cladakfu xarci”, and “cladakfu” is itself a symmetrical lujvo, we can do the necessary analyses all at once. Plainly c1 (the long thing), d1 (the knife), and xa1 (the weapon) are all the same. Likewise, the d2 place (the thing cut) is the same as the xa2 place (the target of the weapon), given that swords are used to cut victims. Finally, the c2 place (direction of length) is always along the sword blade in a longsword, by definition, and so is dependent on c1=d1=xa1. Adding on the places of the remaining gismu in right-to-left order we get:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d5>8.5)	xa1=d1=c1 is a long-sword for use against xa2=d2 by wielder xa3, 
with a blade made of d3, length measured by standard c3.
</pre><p>If the last place sounds unimportant to you, notice that what counts legally as a “sword”, rather than just a “knife”, depends on the length of the blade (the legal limit varies in different jurisdictions). This fifth place of “cladakyxa'i” may not often be explicitly filled, but it is still useful on occasion. Because it is so seldom important, it is best that it be last.

<a name=s9><h3>Eliding SE rafsi from seltau</h3>
<p>
<cx "lujvo, dropping SE rafsi">  XE "lujvo: dropping SE rafsi"   It is common to form lujvo that omit the rafsi based on cmavo of selma'o SE, as well as other cmavo rafsi. Doing so makes lujvo construction for common or useful constructions shorter. Since it puts more strain on the listener who has not heard the lujvo before, the shortness of the word should not necessarily outweigh ease in understanding, especially if the lujvo refers to a rare or unusual concept.
<p>
<cx "proposed law">  XE "proposed law"   Consider as an example the lujvo “ti'ifla”, from the veljvo “stidi flalu”, and meaning “bill, proposed law”. The gismu place structures are:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	“stidi”:  agent st1 suggests idea/action st2 to audience st3
	“flalu”:  f1 is a law specifying f2 for community f3 under conditions f4
by lawgiver f5
</pre><cx "lined up">  XE "lined up"   This lujvo does not fit any of our existing molds: it is the second seltau place, st2, that is equivalent to one of the tertau places, namely f1. However, if we understand “ti'ifla” as an abbreviation for the lujvo “selti'ifla”, then we get the first places of seltau and tertau lined up. The place structure of “selti'i” is: <dl compact><dt>		<dd>
<a name=e9d2>9.2)	“selti'i”:  idea/action se1 is suggested by agent se2 to audience se3
</dl><p>Here we can see that se1 (what is suggested) is equivalent to f1 (the law), and we get a normal symmetrical lujvo. The final place structure is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d3>9.3)	f1=se1 is a bill specifying f2 for community f3 under conditions f4
by suggester se2 to audience/lawgivers f5=se3
</pre>or, relabeling the places,
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d4>9.4)	f1=st2 is a bill specifying f2 for community f3 under conditions f4
by suggester st1 to audience/lawgivers f5=st3
</pre>where the last place (st3) is probably some sort of legislature.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, abbreviated">  XE "lujvo: abbreviated"   Abbreviated lujvo like “ti'ifla” are more intuitive (for the lujvo-maker) than their more explicit counterparts like “selti'ifla” (as well as shorter). They don't require the coiner to sit down and work out the precise relation between the seltau and the tertau: he or she can just rattle off a rafsi pair. But should the lujvo get to the stage where a place structure needs to be worked out, then the precise relation does need to be specified. And in that case, such abbreviated lujvo form a trap in lujvo place ordering, since they obscure the most straightforward relation between the seltau and tertau. To give our lujvo-making guidelines as wide an application as possible, and to encourage analyzing the seltau-tertau relation in lujvo, lujvo like “ti'ifla” are given the place structure they would have with the appropriate SE added to the seltau.
<p>
<cx "implausible">  XE "implausible"   <cx "abbreviated lujvo and plausibility">  XE "abbreviated lujvo and plausibility"   <cx "plausibility, in abbreviated lujvo">  XE "plausibility: in abbreviated lujvo"   Note that, with these lujvo, an interpretation requiring SE insertion is safe only if the alternatives are either implausible or unlikely to be needed as a lujvo. This may not always be the case, and Lojbanists should be aware of the risk of ambiguity.
<p>
<a name=s10><h3>Eliding SE rafsi from tertau</h3>
<p>
<cx "lujvo place structure, effect of “SE”-dropping in tertau">  XE "lujvo place structure: effect of SE-dropping in tertau"   Eliding SE rafsi from tertau gets us into much more trouble. To understand why, recall that lujvo, following their veljvo, describe some type of whatever their tertau describe. Thus, “posydji” describes a type of “djica”, “gerzda” describes a type of “zdani”, and so on. What is certain is that “gerzda” does not describe a “se zdani” — it is not a word that could be used to describe an inhabitant such as a dog.
<p>
<ex "blue-eyed">  XE "blue-eyed: example“  Now consider how we would translate the word “blue-eyed”. Let's tentatively translate this word as “blakanla” (from “blanu kanla”, meaning “blue eye”). But immediately we are in trouble: we cannot say
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d1>10.1)	la djak. cu blakanla
	Jack is-a-blue-eye
</pre>because Jack is not an eye, “kanla”, but someone with an eye, “se kanla”. At best we can say
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d2>10.2)	la djak. cu se blakanla
	Jack is-the-bearer-of-blue-eyes
</pre><p>But look now at the place structure of “blakanla”: it is a symmetrical lujvo, so the place structure is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d3>10.3)	bl1=k1 is a blue eye of bl2=k2
</pre><p>We end up being most interested in talking about the second place, not the first (we talk much more of people than of their eyes), so “se” would almost always be required.
<p>
What is happening here is that we are translating the tertau wrongly, under the influence of English. The English suffix “-eyed” does not mean “eye”, but someone with an eye, which is “selkanla”.
<p>
Because we've got the wrong tertau (eliding a “se” that really should be there), any attempt to accommodate the resulting lujvo into our guidelines for place structure is fitting a square peg in a round hole. Since they can be so misleading, lujvo with SE rafsi elided from the tertau should be avoided in favor of their more explicit counterparts: in this case, “blaselkanla”.
<p>
<a name=s11><h3>Eliding KE and KEhE rafsi from lujvo</h3>
<p>
<cx "lujvo place structure, dropping “KE”">  XE "lujvo place structure: dropping KE"   <cx "lujvo place structure, dropping “KEhE”">  XE "lujvo place structure: dropping KEhE"   People constructing lujvo usually want them to be as short as possible. To that end, they will discard any cmavo they regard as niceties. The first such cmavo to get thrown out are usually “ke” and “ke'e”, the cmavo used to structure and group tanru. We can usually get away with this, because the interpretation of the tertau with “ke” and “ke'e” missing is less plausible than that with the cmavo inserted, or because the distinction isn't really important.
<p>
<cx "beefsteak">  XE "beefsteak"   <ex "beefsteak">  XE "beefsteak: example“  For example, in “bakrecpa'o”, meaning “beefsteak”, the veljvo is
<p>
  XE "bovine: example"  <pre><a name=e11d1>11.1)	[ke] bakni rectu [ke'e] panlo
	( bovine meat ) slice
</pre>because of the usual Lojban left-grouping rule. But there doesn't seem to be much difference between that veljvo and
<p>
  XE "meat slice: example"  <pre><a name=e11d2>11.2)	bakni ke rectu panlo [ke'e]
	bovine ( meat slice )
</pre><ex "sneak in">  XE "sneak in: example“  On the other hand, the lujvo “zernerkla”, meaning “to sneak in”, almost certainly was formed from the veljvo
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d3>11.3)	zekri ke nenri klama [ke'e]
	crime ( inside go )
	to go within, criminally
</pre>because the alternative,
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d4>11.4)	[ke] zekri nenri [ke'e] klama
	(crime inside) go
</pre>doesn't make much sense. (To go to the inside of a crime? To go into a place where it is criminal to be inside — an interpretation almost identical with <a href=#e11d3>Example 11.3 </a>anyway?)
<p>
<cx "shellfish">  XE "shellfish"   <ex "shellfish">  XE "shellfish: example“  There are cases, however, where omitting a KE or KEhE rafsi can produce another lujvo, equally useful. For example, “xaskemcakcurnu” means “oceanic shellfish”, and has the veljvo

	(ocean shell) type-of worm

<cx "misinterpretation">  XE "misinterpretation"   <cx "lujvo creation, interaction of KE with SE">  XE "lujvo creation: interaction of KE with SE"   <cx "lujvo creation, interaction of KE with NAhE">  XE "lujvo creation: interaction of KE with NAhE"   Such misinterpretation is more likely than not in a lujvo starting with “sel-” (from “se”), “nal-” (from “na'e”) or “tol-” (from “to'e”): the scope of the rafsi will likeliest be presumed to be as narrow as possible, since all of these cmavo normally bind only to the following brivla or “ke <dots>…</dots>ke'e” group. For that reason, if we want to modify an entire lujvo by putting “se”, “na'e” or “to'e” before it, it's better to leave the result as two words, or else to insert “ke”, than to just stick the SE or NAhE rafsi on.
<p>
It is all right to replace the phrase “se klama” with “selkla”, and the places of “selkla” are exactly those of “se klama”. But consider the related lujvo “dzukla”, meaning “to walk to somewhere”. It is a symmmetrical lujvo, derived from the veljvo “cadzu klama” as follows:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d7>	“cadzu”:  c1 walks on surface c2 using limbs c3
	“klama”:  k1 goes to k2 from k3 via route k4 using k5
	“dzukla”:  c1=k1 walks to k2 from k3 via route k4 using limbs k5=c3
		on surface c2
</pre><p>We can swap the k1 and k2 places using “se dzukla”, but we cannot directly make “se dzukla” into “seldzukla”, which would represent the veljvo “selcadzu klama” and plausibly mean something like “to go to a walking surface”. Instead, we would need “selkemdzukla”, with an explicit rafsi for “ke”. Similarly, “nalbrablo” (from “na'e barda bloti”) means “non-big boat”, whereas “na'e brablo” means “other than a big boat”.
<p>
<cx "lujvo creation, use of multiple SE in">  XE "lujvo creation: use of multiple SE in"   If the lujvo we want to modify with SE has a seltau already starting with a SE rafsi, we can take a shortcut. For instance, “gekmau” means “happier than”, while “selgekmau” means “making people happier than, more enjoyable than, more of a 'se gleki' than”. If something is less enjoyable than something else, we can say it is “se selgekmau”.
<p>
But we can also say it is “selselgekmau”. Two “se” cmavo in a row cancel each other (“se se gleki” means the same as just “gleki”), so there would be no good reason to have “selsel” in a lujvo with that meaning. Instead, we can feel free to interpret “selsel-” as “selkemsel-”. The rafsi combinations “terter-”, “velvel-” and “xelxel-” work in the same way.
<p>
Other SE combinations like “selter-”, although they might conceivably mean “se te”, more than likely should be interpreted in the same way, namely as “se ke te”, since there is no need to re-order places in the way that “se te” provides. (See <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>.)

<a name=s12><h3>Abstract lujvo</h3>
<p>
<cx "lujvo, abstract">  XE "lujvo: abstract"   <cx "abstract lujvo">  XE "abstract lujvo"   <cx "lujvo place structure, “nu” lujvo">  XE "lujvo place structure: \“nu\” lujvo"   The cmavo of NU can participate in the construction of lujvo of a particularly simple and well-patterned kind. Consider that old standard example, “klama”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d1>12.1)	k1 comes/goes to k2 from k3 via route k4 by means k5.
</pre><p>The selbri “nu klama [kei]” has only one place, the event-of-going, but the full five places exist implicitly between “nu” and “kei”, since a full bridi with all sumti may be placed there. In a lujvo, there is no room for such inside places, and consequently the lujvo “nunkla” (“nun-” is the rafsi for “nu”), needs to have six places:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d2>12.2)	nu1 is the event of k1's coming/going to k2 from k3 via route k4 
by means k5.
</pre><p>Here the first place of “nunklama” is the first and only place of “nu”, and the other five places have been pushed down by one to occupy the second through the sixth places. Full information on “nu”, as well as the other abstractors mentioned in this section, is given in <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11</a>.
<p>
<cx "lujvo place structure, “ni” lujvo">  XE "lujvo place structure: \“ni\” lujvo"   <cx "lujvo place structure, multi-place abstraction lujvo">  XE "lujvo place structure: multi-place abstraction lujvo"   For those abstractors which have a second place as well, the standard convention is to place this place after, rather than before, the places of the brivla being abstracted. The place structure of “nilkla”, the lujvo derived from “ni klama”, is the imposing:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d3>12.3)	ni1 is the amount of k1's coming/going to k2 from k3 via route k4 
by means k5, measured on scale ni2.
</pre><p>It is not uncommon for abstractors to participate in the making of more complex lujvo as well. For example, “nunsoidji”, from the veljvo
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d4>12.4)	nu sonci kei djica
	event-of being-a-soldier desirer
</pre>has the place structure
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d5>12.5)	d1 desires the event of (s1 being a soldier of army s2) for purpose d3
</pre><cx "lujvo place order, multi-part with “NU”">  XE "lujvo place order: multi-part with NU"   where the d2 place has disappeared altogether, being replaced by the places of the seltau. As shown in <a href=#e12d5>Example 12.5</a>, the ordering follows this idea of replacement: the seltau places are inserted at the point where the omitted abstraction place exists in the tertau.
<p>
<cx "asymmetric lujvo">  XE "asymmetric lujvo"   The lujvo “nunsoidji” is quite different from the ordinary asymmetric lujvo “soidji”, a “soldier desirer”, whose place structure is just
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d6>12.6)	d1 desires (a soldier of army s2) for purpose d3
</pre><p>A “nunsoidji” might be someone who is about to enlist, whereas a “soidji” might be a camp-follower.
<p>
<cx "abstract lujvo, contrasted with abstract bridi">  XE "abstract lujvo: contrasted with abstract bridi"   One use of abstract lujvo is to eliminate the need for explicit “kei” in tanru: “nunkalri gasnu” means much the same as “nu kalri kei gasnu”, but is shorter. In addition, many English words ending in “-hood” are represented with “nun-” lujvo, and other words ending in “-ness” or “-dom” are often representable with “kam-” lujvo (“kam-” is the rafsi for “ka”); “kambla” is “blueness”.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, scope abstraction in underlying veljvo">  XE "lujvo: scope abstraction in underlying veljvo"   Even though the cmavo of NU are long-scope in nature, governing the whole following bridi, the NU rafsi should generally be used as short-scope modifiers, like the SE and NAhE rafsi discussed in <a href=#s9>Section 9</a>.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, with “jai”">  XE "lujvo: with \“jai\”"   There is also a rafsi for the cmavo “jai”, namely “jax”, which allows sentences like

</pre><cx "lujvo place structure, with “jai” lujvo">  XE "lujvo place structure: with \“jai\” lujvo"   <lx "fai">  XE "fai"   <lx "jai">  XE "jai"   In making a lujvo that contains “jax-” for a selbri that contains “jai”, the rule is to leave the “fai” place as a “fai” place of the lujvo; it does not participate in the regular lujvo place structure. (The use of “fai” is also explained in <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11</a>.)
<p>
<a name=s13><h3>Implicit-abstraction lujvo</h3>
<p>
<cx "lujvo, dropping NU rafsi">  XE "lujvo: dropping NU rafsi"   Eliding NU rafsi involves the same restrictions as eliding SE rafsi, plus additional ones. In general, NU rafsi should not be elided from the tertau, since that changes the kind of thing the lujvo is talking about from an abstraction to a concrete sumti. However, they may be elided from the seltau if no reasonable ambiguity would result.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, NU-dropping contrasted with SE-dropping">  XE "lujvo: NU-dropping contrasted with SE-dropping"   <cx "lujvo, implicit-abstraction">  XE "lujvo: implicit-abstraction"   A major difference, however, between SE elision and NU elision is that the former is a rather sparse process, providing a few convenient shortenings. Eliding “nu”, however, is extremely important in producing a class of lujvo called “implicit-abstraction lujvo”.
<p>
<ex "feed">  XE "feed: example“  Let us make a detailed analysis of the lujvo “nunctikezgau”, meaning “to feed”. (If you think this lujvo is excessively longwinded, be patient.) The veljvo of “nunctikezgau” is “nu citka kei gasnu”. The relevant place structures are:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d1>13.1)	“nu”:  n1 is an event
	“citka”:  c1 eats c2
	“gasnu”:  g1 does action/is the agent of event g2
</pre><p>In accordance with the procedure for analyzing three-part lujvo given in <a href=#s8>Section 8</a>, we will first create an intermediate lujvo, “nuncti”, whose veljvo is “nu citka [kei]”. By the rules given in <a href=#s12>Section 12</a>, “nuncti” has the place structure
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d2>13.2)	n1 is the event of c1 eating c2
</pre><cx "lujvo place structure, dropping first place of NU">  XE "lujvo place structure: dropping first place of NU"   Now we can transform the veljvo of “nunctikezgau” into “nuncti gasnu”. The g2 place (what is brought about by the actor g1) obviously denotes the same thing as n1 (the event of eating). So we can eliminate g2 as redundant, leaving us with a tentative place structure of
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d3>13.3)	g1 is the actor in the event n1=g2 of c1 eating c2
</pre><p>But it is also possible to omit the n1 place itself! The n1 place describes the event brought about; an event in Lojban is described as a bridi, by a selbri and its sumti; the selbri is already known (it's the seltau), and the sumti are also already known (they're in the lujvo place structure). So n1 would not give us any information we didn't already know. In fact, the n1=g2 place is dependent on c1 and c2 jointly — it does not depend on either c1 or c2 by itself. Being dependent and derived from the seltau, it is omissible.
So the final place structure of “nunctikezgau” is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d4>13.4)	g1 is the actor in the event of c1 eating c2
</pre><cx "lujvo, asymmetric abstraction">  XE "lujvo: asymmetric abstraction"   <cx "abstraction lujvo, asymmetric">  XE "abstraction lujvo: asymmetric"   There is one further step that can be taken. As we have already seen with “balsoi” in <a href=#s5>Section 5</a>, the interpretation of lujvo is constrained by the semantics of gismu and of their sumti places. Now, any asymmetrical lujvo with “gasnu” as its tertau will involve an event abstraction either implicitly or explicitly, since that is how the g2 place of “gasnu” is defined.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, dropping NU in implicit abstractions">  XE "lujvo: dropping NU in implicit abstractions"   Therefore, if we assume that “nu” is the type of abstraction one would expect to be a “se gasnu”, then the rafsi “nun” and “kez” in “nunctikezgau” are only telling us what we would already have guessed — that the seltau of a “gasnu” lujvo is an event. If we drop these rafsi out, and use instead the shorter lujvo “ctigau”, rejecting its symmetrical interpretation (“someone who both does and eats”; “an eating doer”), we can still deduce that the seltau refers to an event.
<p>
(You can't “do an eater”/“gasnu lo citka”, with the meaning of “do” as “bring about an event”; so the seltau must refer to an event, “nu citka”. The English slang meanings of “do someone”, namely “socialize with someone” and “have sex with someone”, are not relevant to “gasnu”.)
<p>
So we can simply use “ctigau” with the same place structure as “nunctikezgau”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d5>13.5)	agent g1 causes c1 to eat c2
	g1 feeds c2 to c1.
</pre><cx "implicit-abstraction lujvo, definition">  XE "implicit-abstraction lujvo: definition"   This particular kind of asymmetrical lujvo, in which the seltau serves as the selbri of an abstraction which is a place of the tertau, is called an implicit-abstraction lujvo, because one deduces the presence of an abstraction which is unexpressed (implicit).
<p>
<ex "replace">  XE "replace: example“  To give another example: the gismu “basti”, whose place structure is
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d6>13.6)	b1 replaces b2 in circumstances b3
</pre>can form the lujvo “basygau”, with the place structure:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d7>13.7)	g1 (agent) replaces b1 with b2 in circumstances b3
</pre>where both “basti” and “basygau” are translated “replace” in English, but represent different relations: “basti” may be used with no mention of any agent doing the replacing.
<p>
In addition, “gasnu”-based lujvo can be built from what we would consider nouns or adjectives in English. In Lojban, everything is a predicate, so adjectives, nouns and verbs are all treated in the same way. This is consistent with the use of similar causative affixes in other languages. For example, the gismu “litki”, meaning “liquid”, with the place structure
<p>
<ex "liquefy">  XE "liquefy: example“  <pre><a name=e13d8>13.8)	l1 is a quantity of liquid of composition l2 under conditions l3
</pre>can give “likygau”, meaning “to liquefy”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d9>13.9)	g1 (agent) causes l1 to be a quantity of liquid of composition l2
under conditions l3.
</pre><p>While “likygau” correctly represents “causes to be a liquid”, a different lujvo based on “galfi” (meaning “modify”) may be more appropriate for “causes to become a liquid”. On the other hand, “fetsygau” is potentially confusing, because it could mean “agent in the event of something becoming female” (the implicit-abstraction interpretation) or simply “female agent” (the parallel interpretation), so using implicit-abstraction lujvo is always accompanied with some risk of being misunderstood.
<p>
<ex "sun liquefies">  XE "sun liquefies: example“  Many other Lojban gismu have places for event abstractions, and therefore are good candidates for the tertau of an implicit-abstraction lujvo. For example, lujvo based on “rinka”, with its place structure
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d10>13.10)	event r1 causes event r2 to occur
</pre>are closely related to those based on “gasnu”. However, “rinka” is less generally useful than “gasnu”, because its r1 place is another event rather than a person: “lo rinka” is a cause, not a causer. Thus the place structure of “likyri'a”, a lujvo analogous to “likygau”, is
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d11>13.11)	event r1 causes l1 to be a quantity of liquid of composition l2
under conditions l3
</pre>and would be useful in translating sentences like “The heat of the sun liquefied the block of ice.”

<pre><a name=e14d2>14.2)	s1 is a text expressed by s2 to audience s3 in medium s4
Now it is easy to see that the l2 and s2 places are equivalent: the believer in the religion (l2) is the one who expresses the prayer (s2). This is not one of the cases for which a place ordering rule has been given in <a href=#s7>Section 7 </a>or <a href=#s13>Section 13</a>; therefore, for lack of a better rule, we put the tertau places first and the remaining seltau places after them, leading to the place structure:
<a name=e14d3>14.3)	s1 is a prayer expressed by s2=l2 to audience s3 in medium s4 
pertaining to religion l1
</pre><p>The l3 place (the beliefs of the religion) is dependent on the l1 place (the religion) and so is omitted.
<p>
We could make this lujvo less messy by replacing it with “se seljdasku”, where “seljdasku” is a normal symmetrical lujvo with place structure:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d4>14.4)	c1=l2 religiously expresses prayer c2 to audience c3 in medium s4 
pertaining to religion l1
</pre>which, according to the rule expressed in <a href=#s9>Section 9</a>, can be further expressed as “selseljdasku”. However, there is no need for the ugly “selsel-” prefix just to get the rules right: “jdaselsku” is a reasonable, if anomalous, lujvo.
<p>
However, there is a further problem with “jdaselsku”, not resolvable by using “seljdasku”. No veljvo involving just the two gismu “lijda” and “cusku” can fully express the relationship implicit in prayer. A prayer is not just anything said by the adherents of a religion; nor is it even anything said by them acting as adherents of that religion. Rather, it is what they say under the authority of that religion, or using the religion as a medium, or following the rules associated with the religion, or something of the kind. So the veljvo is somewhat elliptical.
<p>
As a result, both “seljdasku” and “jdaselsku” belong to the second class of anomalous lujvo: the veljvo doesn't really supply all that the lujvo requires.
<p>
<cx "sheepdog">  XE "sheepdog"   <ex "sheepdog">  XE "sheepdog: example“  <cx "sheep breed">  XE "sheep breed"   <cx "lujvo place order, non-overlapping place structures">  XE "lujvo place order: non-overlapping place structures"   <cx "lujvo place order, complex relation">  XE "lujvo place order: complex relation"   Another example of this kind of anomalous lujvo, drawn from the tanru lists in <a href=chap5.html>Chapter 5</a>, is “lange'u”, meaning “sheepdog”. Clearly a sheepdog is not a dog which is a sheep (the symmetrical interpretation is wrong), nor a dog of the sheep breed (the asymmetrical interpretation is wrong). Indeed, there is simply no overlap in the places of “lanme” and “gerku” at all. Rather, the lujvo refers to a dog which controls sheep flocks, a “terlanme jitro gerku”, the lujvo from which is “terlantroge'u” with place structure:
<p>
  XE "sheep flock: example"  <pre><a name=e14d5>14.5)	g1=j1 is a dog that controls sheep flock l3=j2 made up of sheep l1 
in activity j3 of dog breed g2
</pre>based on the gismu place structures
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d6>14.6)	“lanme”:  l1 is a sheep of breed l2 belonging to flock l3
	“gerku”:  g1 is a dog of breed g2
	“jitro”:  j1 controls j2 in activity j3
</pre><p>Note that this lujvo is symmetrical between “lantro” (sheep-controller) and “gerku”, but “lantro” is itself a asymmetrical lujvo. The l2 place, the breed of sheep, is removed as dependent on l1. However, the lujvo “lange'u” is both shorter than “terlantroge'u” and sufficiently clear to warrant its use: its place structure, however, should be the same as that of the longer lujvo, for which “lange'u” can be understood as an abbreviation.
<p>
<ex "beckon">  XE "beckon: example“  <cx "lujvo place order, elliptical lujvo">  XE "lujvo place order: elliptical lujvo"   Another example is “xanmi'e”, “to command by hand, to beckon”. The component place structures are:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d7>14.7)	“xance”:  xa1 is the hand of xa2
	“minde”:  m1 gives commands to m2 to cause m3 to happen
</pre><p>The relation between the seltau and tertau is close enough for there to be an overlap: xa2 (the person with the hand) is the same as m1 (the one who commands). But interpreting “xanmi'e” as a symmetrical lujvo with an elided “sel-” in the seltau, as if from “se xance mindu”, misses the point: the real relation expressed by the lujvo is not just “one who commands and has a hand”, but “to command using the hand”. The concept of “using” suggests the gismu “pilno”, with place structure
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d8>14.8)	p1 uses tool p2 for purpose p3
</pre><p>Some possible three-part veljvo are (depending on how strictly you want to constrain the veljvo)

<p>
<pre><a name=e14d11>14.11)	minde ke xance pilno [ke'e]

</pre>which lead to the three different lujvo “xanplimi'e”, “mi'erxanpli”, and “minkemxanpli” respectively.
<p>
<cx "latent component">  XE "latent component"   Does this make “xanmi'e” wrong? By no means. But it does mean that there is a latent component to the meaning of “xanmi'e”, the gismu “pilno”, which is not explicit in the veljvo. And it also means that, for a place structure derivation that actually makes sense, rather than being ad-hoc, the Lojbanist should probably go through a derivation for “xancypliminde” or one of the other possibilities that is analogous to the analysis of “terlantroge'u” above, even if he or she decides to stick with a shorter, more convenient form like “xanmi'e”. In addition, of course, the possibilities of elliptical lujvo increase their potential ambiguity enormously — an unavoidable fact which should be borne in mind.
<p>
<a name=s15><h3>Comparatives and superlatives</h3>
<p>
<cx "lujvo, comparatives">  XE "lujvo: comparatives"   <cx "lujvo, superlatives">  XE "lujvo: superlatives"   English has the concepts of “comparative adjectives” and “superlative adjectives” which can be formed from other adjectives, either by adding the suffixes “-er” and “-est” or by using the words “more” and “most”, respectively. The Lojbanic equivalents, which can be made from any brivla, are lujvo with the tertau “zmadu”, “mleca”, “zenba”, “jdika”, and “traji”. In order to make these lujvo regular and easy to make, certain special guidelines are imposed.
<p>
We will begin with lujvo based on “zmadu” and “mleca”, whose place structures are:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d1>15.1)	“zmadu”:  z1 is more than z2 in property z3 in quantity z4
	“mleca”:  m1 is less than m2 in property m3 in quantity m4
</pre><p>For example, the concept “young” is expressed by the gismu “citno”, with place structure
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d2>15.2)	“citno”:  c1 is young
</pre><cx "lujvo place order, comparatives">  XE "lujvo place order: comparatives"   <ex "younger">  XE "younger: example“  The comparative concept “younger” can be expressed by the lujvo “citmau” (based on the veljvo “citno zmadu”, meaning “young more-than”).
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d3>15.3)	mi citmau do lo nanca be li xa
	I am-younger-than you by-years the-number six.
	I am six years younger than you.
</pre><p>The place structure for “citmau” is
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d4>15.4)	z1=c1 is younger than z2=c1 by amount z4
</pre><p>Similarly, in Lojban you can say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d5>15.5)	do citme'a mi lo nanca be li xa
	You are-less-young-than me by-years the-number six.
	You are six years less young than me.
</pre><p>In English, “more” comparatives are easier to make and use than “less” comparatives, but in Lojban the two forms are equally easy.
<p>
Because of their much simpler place structure, lujvo ending in “mau” and “me'a” are in fact used much more frequently than “zmadu” and “mleca” themselves as selbri. It is highly unlikely for such lujvo to be construed as anything other than implicit-abstraction lujvo. But there is another type of ambiguity relevant to these lujvo, and which has to do with what is being compared.
<p>
<cx "comparative lujvo, potential ambiguity in">  XE "comparative lujvo: potential ambiguity in"   For example, does “nelcymau” mean “X likes Y more than X likes Z”, or “X likes Y more than Z likes Y”? Does “klamau” mean: “X goes to Y more than to Z”, “X goes to Y more than Z does”, “X goes to Y from Z more than from W”, or what?
<p>
<cx "comparative lujvo, standardized meanings">  XE "comparative lujvo: standardized meanings"   <cx "lujvo place structure, comparative lujvo">  XE "lujvo place structure: comparative lujvo"   We answer this concern by putting regularity above any considerations of concept usefulness: by convention, the two things being compared always fit into the first place of the seltau. In that way, each of the different possible interpretations can be expressed by SE-converting the seltau, and making the required place the new first place. As a result, we get the following comparative lujvo place structures:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d6>15.6)	“nelcymau”:  z1, more than z2, likes n2 by amount z4
	“selnelcymau”:  z1, more than z2, is liked by n1 in amount z4
	“klamau”:  z1, more than z2, goes to k2 from k3 via k4 by means of k5
	“selklamau”:  z1, more than z2, is gone to by k1 from k3 via k4 
by means of k5
	“terklamau”:  z1, more than z2, is an origin point from destination k2 
for k1's going via k4 by means of k5
</pre>(See <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11 </a>for the way in which this problem is resolved when lujvo aren't used.)
<p>
The ordering rule places the things being compared first, and the other seltau places following. Unfortunately the z4 place, which expresses by how much one entity exceeds the other, is displaced into a lujvo place whose number is different for each lujvo. For example, while “nelcymau” has z4 as its fourth place, “klamau” has it as its sixth place. In any sentence where a difficulty arises, this amount-place can be redundantly tagged with “vemau” (for “zmadu”) or “veme'a” (for “mleca”) to help make the speaker's intention clear.
<p>
<cx "nonagenarian">  XE "nonagenarian"   <cx "octogenarian">  XE "octogenarian"   <cx "comparative lujvo, and seltau presupposition">  XE "comparative lujvo: and seltau presupposition"   It is important to realize that such comparative lujvo do not presuppose their seltau. Just as in English, saying someone is younger than someone else doesn't imply that they're young in the first place: an octogenarian, after all, is still younger than a nonagenarian. Rather, the 80-year-old has a greater “ni citno” than the 90-year-old. Similarly, a 5-year-old is older than a 1-year-old, but is not considered “old” by most standards.
<p>
<cx "former state">  XE "former state"   <cx "comparative lujvo, against former state">  XE "comparative lujvo: against former state"   There are some comparative concepts which are in which the “se zmadu” is difficult to specify. Typically, these involve comparisons implicitly made with a former state of affairs, where stating a z2 place explicitly would be problematic.
<p>
In such cases, it is best not to use “zmadu” and leave the comparison hanging, but to use instead the gismu “zenba”, meaning “increase” (and “jdika”, meaning “decrease”, in place of “mleca”). The gismu “zenba” was included in the language precisely in order to capture those notions of increase which “zmadu” can't quite cope with; in addition, we don't have to waste a place in lujvo or tanru on something that we'd never fill in with a value anyway. So we can translate “I'm stronger now” not as
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d7>15.7)	mi ca tsamau
	I now am-stronger.
</pre>which implies that I'm currently stronger than somebody else (the elided occupant of the second or z2 place), but as
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d8>15.8)	mi ca tsaze'a
	I increase in strength.
</pre><p>Finally, lujvo with a tertau of “traji” are used to build superlatives. The place structure of “traji” is
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d9>15.9)	t1 is superlative in property t2, being the t3 extremum (largest by default) 
of set t4
</pre><p>Consider the gismu “xamgu”, whose place structure is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d10>15.10)	xa1 is good for xa2 by standard xa3
</pre><ex "better">  XE "better: example“  The comparative form is “xagmau”, corresponding to English “better”, with a place structure (by the rules given above) of
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d11>15.11)	z1 is better than z2 for xa2 by standard xa3 in amount z4
</pre><cx "lujvo place structure, superlatives">  XE "lujvo place structure: superlatives"   <cx "lujvo place order, superlatives">  XE "lujvo place order: superlatives"   We would expect the place structure of “xagrai”, the superlative form, to somehow mirror that, given that comparatives and superlatives are comparable concepts, resulting in:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d12>15.12)	xa1=t1 is the best of the set t4 for xa2 by standard xa3.
</pre><p>The t2 place in “traji”, normally filled by a property abstraction, is replaced by the seltau places, and the t3 place specifying the extremum of “traji” (whether the most or the least, that is) is presumed by default to be “the most”.
<p>
<cx "lujvo place order, superlatives as exceptions">  XE "lujvo place order: superlatives as exceptions"   But the set against which the t1 place of “traji” is compared is not the t2 place (which would make the place structure of “traji” fully parallel to that of “zmadu”), but rather the t4 place. Nevertheless, by a special exception to the rules of place ordering, the t4 place of “traji”-based lujvo becomes the second place of the lujvo. Some examples:
<p>
  XE "Judy: example"  <pre><a name=e15d12>15.13)	la djudis. cu citrai lo'i lobypli
	Judy is the youngest of all Lojbanists.
  XE "Einstein: example"  <pre><a name=e15d13>15.14)	la ainctain. cu balrai lo'i skegunka
	Einstein was the greatest of all scientists.
</pre><a name=s16><h3>Notes on gismu place structures</h3>
<p>
<cx "gismu place structures">  XE “gismu: place structures"   <cx "place structure, gismu">  XE "place structure: gismu"   Unlike the place structures of lujvo, the place structures of gismu were assigned in a far less systematic way through a detailed case-by-case analysis and repeated reviews with associated changes. (The gismu list is now baselined, so no further changes are contemplated.) Nevertheless, certain regularities were imposed both in the choice of places and in the ordering of places which may be helpful to the learner and the lujvo-maker, and which are therefore discussed here.
<p>
<cx "gismu place structures, rationale">  XE “gismu: place structures, rationale"   The choice of gismu places results from the varying outcome of four different pressures: brevity, convenience, metaphysical necessity, and regularity. (These are also to some extent the underlying factors in the lujvo place structures generated by the methods of this chapter.) The implications of each are roughly as follows:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>Brevity tends to remove places: the fewer places a gismu has, the easier it is to learn, and the less specific it is. As mentioned in <a href=#s4>Section 4</a>, a brivla with fewer place structures is less specific, and generality is a virtue in gismu, because they must thoroughly blanket all of semantic space.
<p><dt><dd>Convenience tends to increase the number of places: if a concept can be expressed as a place of some existing gismu, there is no need to make another gismu, a lujvo or a fu'ivla for it.
<p><dt><dd>Metaphysical necessity can either increase or decrease places: it is a pressure tending to provide the “right number” of places. If something is part of the essential nature of a concept, then a place must be made for it; on the other hand, if instances of the concept need not have some property, then this pressure will tend to remove the place.
<p><dt><dd>Regularity is a pressure which can also either increase or decrease places. If a gismu has a given place, then gismu which are semantically related to it are likely to have the place also.
</dl><p>Here are some examples of gismu place structures, with a discussion of the pressures operating on them:
<p>
<pre><a name=e16d1>16.1)	“xekri”:  xe1 is black
</pre><cx "color standards">  XE "color standards"   Brevity was the most important goal here, reinforced by one interpretation of metaphysical necessity. There is no mention of color standards here, as many people have pointed out; like all color gismu, “xekri” is explicitly subjective. Objective color standards can be brought in by an appropriate BAI tag such as “ci'u” (“in system”; see <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>) or by making a lujvo.
<p>
<pre><a name=e16d2>16.2)	“jbena”:  j1 is born to j2 at time j3 and location j4
</pre><p>The gismu “jbena” contains places for time and location, which few other gismu have: normally, the time and place at which something is done is supplied by a tense tag (see <a href=chap10.html>Chapter 10</a>). However, providing these places makes “le te jbena” a simple term for “birthday” and “le ve jbena” for “birthplace”, so these places were provided despite their lack of metaphysical necessity.
<p>
<pre><a name=e16d3>16.3)	“rinka”:  event r1 is the cause of event r2
</pre><cx "melting">  XE "melting"   The place structure of “rinka” does not have a place for the agent, the one who causes, as a result of the pressure toward metaphysical necessity. A cause-effect relationship does not have to include an agent: an event (such as snow melting in the mountains) may cause another event (such as the flooding of the Nile) without any human intervention or even knowledge.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, as suppliers of agent place">  XE "lujvo: as suppliers of agent place"   Indeed, there is a general tendency to omit agent places from most gismu except for a few such as “gasnu” and “zukte” which are then used as tertau in order to restore the agent place when needed: see <a href=#s13>Section 13</a>.
<p>
<pre><a name=e16d4>16.4)	“cinfo”:  c1 is a lion of species/breed c2
</pre><cx "general terms">  XE "general terms"   <cx "diversified species">  XE "diversified species"   The c2 place of “cinfo” is provided as a result of the pressure toward regularity. All animal and plant gismu have such an x2 place; although there is in fact only one species of lion, and breeds of lion, though they exist, aren't all that important in talking about lions. The species/breed place must exist for such diversified species as dogs, and for general terms like “cinki” (insect), and are provided for all other animals and plants as a matter of regularity.
<p>
<cx "gismu place order, rationale">  XE “gismu: place order, rationale"   Less can be said about gismu place structure ordering, but some regularities are apparent. The places tend to appear in decreasing order of psychological saliency or importance. There is an implication within the place structure of “klama”, for example, that “lo klama” (the one going) will be talked about more often, and is thus more important, than “lo se klama” (the destination), which is in turn more important than “lo xe klama” (the means of transport).
<p>
Some specific tendencies (not really rules) can also be observed. For example, when there is an agent place, it tends to be the first place. Similarly, when a destination and an origin point are mentioned, the destination is always placed just before the origin point. Places such as “under conditions” and “by standard”, which often go unfilled, are moved to near the end of the place structure.

<a name=s1><h3>What are attitudinal indicators?</h3>
<cx "attitude">  XE "attitude"   <cx "punctuation">  XE "punctuation"   <cx "tone of voice">  XE "tone of voice"   <cx "feeling">  XE "feeling"   <cx "emotion">  XE "emotion"   This chapter explains the various words that Lojban provides for expressing attitude and related notions. In natural languages, attitudes are usually expressed by the tone of voice when speaking, and (very imperfectly) by punctuation when writing. For example, the bare words
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	John is coming.
</pre>can be made, through tone of voice, to express the speaker's feeling of happiness, pity, hope, surprise, or disbelief. These fine points of tone cannot be expressed in writing. Attitudes are also expressed with various sounds which show up in print as oddly spelled words, such as the “Oooh!”, “Arrgh!”, “Ugh!”, and “Yecch!” in the title. These are part of the English language; people born to other languages use a different set; yet you won't find any of these words in a dictionary.
<p>
<cx "attitudinal indicators">  XE "attitudinal indicators"   In Lojban, everything that can be spoken can also be written. Therefore, these tones of voice must be represented by explicit words known as “attitudinal indicators”, or just “attitudinals”. This rule seems awkward and clunky to English-speakers at first, but is an essential part of the Lojbanic way of doing things.
<p>
<cx "attitidinals, prevailing attitude">  XE "attitudinals: prevailing attitude"   <cx "attitidinals, placement for prevailing attitude">  XE "attitudinals: placement for prevailing attitude"   The simplest way to use attitudinal indicators is to place them at the beginning of a text. In that case, they express the speaker's prevailing attitude. Here are some examples, correlated with the attitudes mentioned following <a href=#e1d1>Example 1.1</a>:
<p>
<ex "John is coming">  XE "John is coming: example“  <lx ".ui">  XE "ui"   <pre><a name=e1d2>1.2)	.ui la djan klama
	[Whee!] John is coming!

	[Alas!] John is coming.
</pre><lx ".a'o">  XE "a'o"   <pre><a name=e1d4>1.4)	.a'o la djan klama
	[Hopefully] John is coming.
</pre><lx ".ue">  XE "ue"   <pre><a name=e1d5>1.5)	.ue la djan klama
	[Wow!] John is coming!
</pre><lx ".ianai">  XE "ianai"   <pre><a name=e1d6>1.6)	.ianai la djan klama
	[Nonsense!] John is coming.
</pre><cx "attitudinals, word-form for primary">  XE "attitudinals: word-form for primary"   <lx "UI">  XE "UI selma’o"   The primary Lojban attitudinals are all the cmavo of the form VV or V'V: one of the few cases where cmavo have been classified solely by their form. There are 39 of these cmavo: all 25 possible vowel pairs of the form V'V, the four standard diphthongs (“.ai”, “.au”, “.ei”, and “.oi”), and the ten more diphthongs that are permitted only in these attitudinal indicators and in names and borrowings (“.ia”, “.ie”, “.ii”, “.io”, “.iu”, “.ua”, “.ue”, “.ui”, “.uo”, and “.uu”). Note that each of these cmavo has a period before it, marking the pause that is mandatory before every word beginning with a vowel. Attitudinals, like most of the other kinds of indicators described in this chapter, belong to selma'o UI.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, compound">  XE "attitudinals: compound"   Attitudinals can also be compound cmavo, of the types explained in Sections 4-8; <a href=#e1d6>Example 1.6 </a>illustrates one such possibility, the compound attitudinal “.ianai”. In attitudinals, “-nai” indicates polar negation: the opposite of the simple attitudinal without the “-nai”. Thus, as you might suppose, “.ia” expresses belief, since “.ianai” expresses disbelief.
<p>
<cx "indicators">  XE "indicators"   <cx "indicators, types of">  XE "indicators: types of"   In addition to the attitudinals, there are other classes of indicators: intensity markers, emotion categories, attitudinal modifiers, observationals, and discursives. All of them are grammatically equivalent, which is why they are treated together in this chapter.
<p>
<cx "indicators, placement of">  XE "indicators: placement of"   Every indicator behaves in more or less the same way with respect to the grammar of the rest of the language. In general, one or more indicators can be inserted at the beginning of an utterance or after any word. Indicators at the beginning apply to the whole utterance; otherwise, they apply to the word that they follow. More details can be found in <a href=#s9>Section 9</a>.
<p>
<cx "indicator tables, format convention">  XE "indicator tables: format convention"   Throughout this chapter, tables of indicators will be written in four columns. The first column is the cmavo itself. The second column is a corresponding English word, not necessarily a literal translation. The fourth column represents the opposite of the second column, and shows the approximate meaning of the attitudinal when suffixed with “-nai”. The third column, which is sometimes omitted, indicates a neutral point between the second and fourth columns, and shows the approximate meaning of the attitudinal when it is suffixed with “-cu'i”. The cmavo “cu'i” belongs to selma'o CAI, and is explained more fully in <a href=#s4>Section 4</a>.
<p>
<cx "feelings, expression of contrasted with talking about">  XE "feelings: expression of contrasted with talking about"   <cx "claims, contrasted with expression of feelings">  XE "claims: contrasted with expression of feelings"   One flaw that the English glosses are particularly subject to is that in English it is often difficult to distinguish between expressing your feelings and talking about them, particularly with the limited resource of the written word. So the gloss for “.ui” should not really be “happiness” but some sound or tone that expresses happiness. However, there aren't nearly enough of those that have unambiguous or obvious meanings in English to go around for all the many, many different emotions Lojban speakers can readily express.
<p>
<cx "indicators, derived from gismu">  XE "indicators: derived from gismu"   <cx "indicators derived from gismu, notation convention">  XE "indicators derived from gismu: notation convention"   Many indicators of CV'V form are loosely derived from specific gismu. The gismu should be thought of as a memory hook, not an equivalent of the cmavo. Such gismu are shown in this chapter between square brackets, thus: [gismu].
<p>
<a name=s2><h3>Pure emotion indicators</h3>
<p>
<cx "attitudinals and claims">  XE "attitudinals and claims"   <cx "attitudinals and truth value">  XE "attitudinals and truth value"   Attitudinals make no claim: they are expressions of attitude, not of facts or alleged facts. As a result, attitudinals themselves have no truth value, nor do they directly affect the truth value of a bridi that they modify. However, since emotional attitudes are carried in your mind, they reflect reactions to that version of the world that the mind is thinking about; this is seldom identical with the real world. At times, we are thinking about our idealized version of the real world; at other times we are thinking about a potential world that might or might not ever exist.

<cx "attitudinals, pure emotion">  XE "attitudinals: pure emotion"   <cx "attitudinals, u- series">  XE "attitudinals: u- series"   <cx "attitudinals, o- series">  XE "attitudinals: o- series"   <cx "attitudinals, i- series">  XE "attitudinals: i- series"   Therefore, there are two groups of attitudinals in Lojban. The “pure emotion indicators” express the way the speaker is feeling, without direct reference to what else is said. These indicators comprise the attitudinals which begin with “u” or “o” and many of those beginning with “i”.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals for emotional reaction">  XE "attitudinals for emotional reaction"   The cmavo beginning with “u” are simple emotions, which represent the speaker's reaction to the world as it is, or as it is perceived to be.
<p>

</pre><p>Here are some typical uses of the “u” attitudinals:
<p>
<ex "Eureka!">  XE "Eureka!: example“   <pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	.ua mi facki fi le mi mapku
	[Eureka!] I found my hat!  [emphasizes the discovery of the hat]

</pre><cx "attitudinal phrase">  XE "attitudinal phrase"   In <a href=#e2d4>Example 2.4</a>, note that the attitudinal “.uo” is translated by an English non-attitudinal phrase: “At last!” It is common for the English equivalents of Lojban attitudinals to be short phrases of this sort, with more or less normal grammar, but actually expressions of emotion.
<p>
<lx "uu">  XE "uu"   <lx "u'u">  XE "u'u"   <cx "uu, contrasted with u'u">  XE "uu: contrasted with u'u"   <cx "u'u, contrasted with uu">  XE "u'u: contrasted with uu"   In particular, both “.uu” and “.u'u” can be translated into English as “I'm sorry”; the difference between these two attitudes frequently causes confusion among English-speakers who use this phrase, leading to responses like “Why are you sorry? It's not your fault!”
<p>
<cx "attitudinals and irony">  XE "attitudinals and irony"   It is important to realize that “.uu”, and indeed all attitudinals, are meant to be used sincerely, not ironically. In English, the exclamation “Pity!” is just as likely to be ironically intended, but this usage does not extend to Lojban. Lying with attitudinals is (normally) as inappropriate to Lojban discourse as any other kind of lying: perhaps worse, because misunderstood emotions can cause even greater problems than misunderstood statements.

<p>
The pure emotion indicators beginning with “i” are those which could not be fitted into the “u” or “o” groups because there was a lack of room, so they are a mixed lot. “.ia”, “.i'a”, “.ie”, and “.i'e” do not appear here, as they belong in <a href=#s3>Section 3 </a>instead.

Lojban-speaking toddlers, if there ever are any, will probably use sentences like <a href=#e2d15>Example 2.15 </a>a lot.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, comparison of meaning based on position">  XE "attitudinals: comparison of meaning based on position"   <a href=#e2d16>Example 2.16 </a>and <a href=#e2d17>Example 2.17 </a>use attitudinals that follow “la djan.” rather than being at the beginning of the sentence. This form means that the attitude is attached to John rather than the event of his coming; the speaker loves or disrespects John specifically. Compare:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d18>2.18)	la djan. klama .iu
	John is-coming [love!]
</pre>where it is specifically the coming of John that inspires the feeling.
<p>
<a href=#e2d17>Example 2.17 </a>is a compact way of swearing at John: you could translate it as “That good-for-nothing John is coming.”

<a name=s3><h3>Propositional attitude indicators</h3>
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, propositional indicators">  XE "attitudinals: propositional indicators"   <cx "propositional, of attitudinals">  XE "propositional: of attitudinals"   <cx "internal world">  XE "internal world"   <cx "hypothetical world">  XE "hypothetical world"   As mentioned at the beginning of <a href=#s2>Section 2</a>, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the “propositional attitude indicators”. These indicators establish an internal, hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards “what the world would be like if <dots>…</dots>”, or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential world a reality.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, emotional contrasted with propositional">  XE "attitudinals: emotional contrasted with propositional"   <cx "attitudinals, propositional contrasted with emotional">  XE "attitudinals: propositional contrasted with emotional"   <cx "attitudinals, propositional effect on claim">  XE "attitudinals: propositional effect on claim"   In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something like “I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it”. The emotion is present with the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional attitudes, though, look more like “I intend to go to the market”, where the main claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually going to the market, but merely that I intend to.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, a- series">  XE "attitudinals: a- series"   <cx "attitudinals, e- series">  XE "attitudinals: e- series"   <cx "attitudinals, i- series">  XE "attitudinals: i- series"   There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with “a” and those beginning with “e”; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the “a”-series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the members of the “e”-series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the “a”-series and the “e”-series is similar to that between the “u”-series and the “o”-series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into the “i”-series as well.

The division of the attitudinals into pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points. Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the “logical language” aspect.
<p>
Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter, starting with those beginning with “a”:
<p>
<pre> 	.a'a	attentive	inattentive	avoiding
	.a'e	alertness		exhaustion
	.ai	intent	indecision	refusal
	.a'i	effort	no real effort	repose

	.au	desire	indifference	reluctance
	.a'u	interest	no interest	repulsion
</pre><p>Some examples (of a parental kind):
<p>
<lx ".a'a">  XE "a'a"   <pre><a name=e3d1>3.1)	.a'a do zgana le veltivni
	[attentive] you observe the television-receiver.

	I have no interest in your complaints.
</pre>(In a real-life situation, Examples 3.1-3.7 would also be decorated by various pure emotion indicators, certainly including “.oicai”, but probably also “.iucai”.)
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, contrasted with bridi">  XE "attitudinals: contrasted with bridi"   <cx "attitudinals, rationale for">  XE "attitudinals: rationale for"   Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended, desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.
<p>
Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with “e”, which stand roughly in the relation to those beginning with “a” as the pure-emotion indicators beginning with “o” do to those beginning with “u” — they are more complex or difficult:
<p>
<pre> 	.e'a	permission		prohibition
	.e'e	competence		incompetence
	.ei	obligation		freedom
	.e'i	constraint	independence	resistance to constraint

<p>
<pre>	.ia	belief	skepticism	disbelief
	.i'a	acceptance		blame
	.ie	agreement		disagreement
	.i'e	approval	non-approval	disapproval

	[disapproval] you [approval] act
	I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.
</pre><a href=#e3d16>Example 3.16 </a>illustrates the use of a propositional attitude indicator, “i'e”, in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure emotion (attached to “do”). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is approved of.
<p>
<cx "attitudinal, signaling as non-propositional">  XE "attitudinal: signaling as non-propositional"   To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into a separate sentence. Thus, a version of <a href=#e3d8>Example 3.8 </a>which actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d17>3.17)	do sazri le karce .i e'a
	You drive the car. [Permission].
	You're driving (or will drive) the car, and that's fine.
</pre><a name=s4><h3>Attitudes as scales</h3>
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, scale of">  XE "attitudinals: scale of"   <cx "attitudinals, positive">  XE "attitudinals: positive"   <cx "attitudinals, negative">  XE "attitudinals: negative"   <cx "attitudinals, neutral">  XE "attitudinals: neutral"   In Lojban, all emotions and attitudes are scales. These scales run from some extreme value (which we'll call “positive”) to an opposite extreme (which we'll call “negative”). In the tables above, we have seen three points on the scale: “positive”, neutral, and “negative”. The terms “positive” and “negative” are put into quotation marks because they are loaded words when applied to emotions, and the attitudinal system reflects this loading, which is a known cultural bias. Only two of the “positive” words, namely “.ii” (fear) and “.oi” (pain/complaint), represent emotions commonly thought of as less “virtuous” in most cases than their negative counterparts. But these two were felt to be instinctive, distinct, and very powerful emotions that needed to be expressible in a monosyllable when necessary, while their counterparts are less commonly expressed.
<p>
<cx "attitudinal scales, rationale for assignment">  XE "attitudinal scales: rationale for assignment"   (Why the overt bias? Because there are a lot of attitudinals and they will be difficult to learn as an entire set. By aligning our scales arbitrarily, we give the monosyllable “nai” a useful meaning and make it easier for a novice to recognize at least the positive or negative alignment of an indicator, if not the specific word. Other choices considered were “random” orientation, which would have unknown biases and be difficult to learn, and orientation based on our guesses as to which scale orientations made the most frequent usages shorter, which would be biased in favor of American perceptions of “usefulness”. If bias must exist in our indicator set, it might as well be a known bias that eases learning, and in addition might as well favor a harmonious and positive world-view.)
<p>
<cx "emotional scale">  XE "emotional scale"   <cx "attitudinal scale, seven-position">  XE "attitudinal scale: seven-position"   <lx "cai">  XE "cai"   <lx "sai">  XE "sai"   <lx "ru'e">  XE "ru'e"   <lx "cu'i">  XE "cu'i"   <lx "nairu'e">  XE "nairu'e"   <lx "naisai">  XE "naisai"   <lx "naicai">  XE "naicai"   <lx "CAI">  XE "CAI selma’o"   In fact, though, each emotional scale has seven positions defined, three “positive” ones (shown below on the left), three “negative” ones (shown below on the right), and a neutral one indicating that no particular attitude on this scale is felt. The following chart indicates the seven positions of the scale and the associated cmavo. All of these cmavo, except “nai”, are in selma'o CAI.
<p>
<pre>cai	sai	ru'e	cu'i	nairu'e	naisai	naicai
[carmi]	[tsali]	[ruble]	[cumki]
</pre><cx "scalar attitude">  XE "scalar attitude"   <cx "attitude, scalar">  XE "attitude: scalar"   A scalar attitude is expressed by using the attitudinal word, and then following it by the desired scalar intensity. The bias creeps in because the “negative” emotions take the extra syllable “nai” to indicate their negative position on the axis, and thus require a bit more effort to express.
<p>
<cx "attitudinal scale, usage">  XE "attitudinal scale: usage"   Much of this system is optional. You can express an attitude without a scale indicator, if you don't want to stop and think about how strongly you feel. Indeed, for most attitudinals, we've found that either no scalar value is used, or “cai” is used to indicate especially high intensity. Less often, “ru'e” is used for a recognizably weak intensity, and “cu'i” is used in response to the attitudinal question “pei” (see <a href=#s10>Section 10</a>) to indicate that the emotion is not felt.
<p>
<cx "attitudinal, example of scale effect">  XE "attitudinal: example of scale effect"   The following shows the variations resulting from intensity variation:
<p>
<lx ".ei">  XE "ei"   <pre><a name=e4d1>4.1)	.ei

	(a non-specific obligation)
</pre><lx ".eicai">  XE "eicai"   <pre><a name=e4d2>4.2)	.eicai

	(no particular obligation)
</pre><lx ".einai">  XE "einai"   <pre><a name=e4d6>4.6)	.einai
	I need not
	(a non-obligation)
</pre><cx "attitudinal scale, stand-alone usage">  XE "attitudinal scale: stand-alone usage"   You can also utter a scale indicator without a specific emotion. This is often used in the language: in order to emphasize a point about which you feel strongly, you mark what you are saying with the scale indicator “cai”. You could also indicate that you don't care using “cu'i” by itself.
<p>
<a name=s5><h3>The space of emotions</h3>
<p>
<cx "attitudinal scale, as axis in emotion-space">  XE "attitudinal scale: as axis in emotion-space"   Each of the attitude scales constitutes an axis in a multi-dimensional space. In effect, given our total so far of 39 scales, we have a 39-dimensional space. At any given time, our emotions and attitudes are represented by a point in this 39-dimensional space, with the intensity indicators serving as coordinates along each dimension. A complete attitudinal inventory, should one decide to express it, would consist of reading off each of the scale values for each of the emotions, with the vector sum serving as a distinct single point, which is our attitude.
<p>
<cx "compound emotions">  XE "compound emotions"   <cx "emotions, compound">  XE "emotions: compound"   <cx "emotion, insights">  XE "emotions: insights"   <cx "emotion, when expressed">  XE "emotions: when expressed"   Now no one is going to ever utter a string of 100-odd attitudinals to express their emotions. If asked, we normally do not recognize more than one or two emotions at a time — usually the ones that are strongest or which most recently changed in some significant way. But the scale system provides some useful insights into a possible theory of emotion (which might be testable using Lojban), and incidentally explains how Lojbanists express compound emotions when they do recognize them.
<p>
<cx "attitudinal scale, neutral compared with positive + negative">  XE "attitudinal scale: neutral compared with positive + negative"   The existence of 39 scales highlights the complexity of emotion. We also aren't bound to the 39. There are modifiers described in <a href=#s6>Section 6 </a>that multiply the set of scales by an order of magnitude. You can also have mixed feelings on a scale, which might be expressed by “cu'i”, but could also be expressed by using both the “positive” and “negative” scale emotions at once. One expression of “fortitude” might be “.ii.iinai” — fear coupled with security.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, order of">  XE "attitudinals: order of"   <cx "attitudinals, contrasted with rationalizations of emotion">  XE "attitudinals: contrasted with rationalizations of emotion"   Uttering one or more attitudinals to express an emotion reflects several things. We will tend to utter emotions in their immediate order of importance to us. We feel several emotions at once, and our expression reflects these emotions simultaneously, although their order of importance to us is also revealing — of our attitude towards our attitude, so to speak. There is little analysis necessary; for those emotions you feel, you express them; the “vector sum” naturally expresses the result. This is vital to their nature as attitudinals — if you had to stop and think about them, or to worry about grammar, they wouldn't be emotions but rationalizations.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, contrasted with bridi">  XE "attitudinals: contrasted with bridi"   People have proposed that attitudinals be expressed as bridi just like everything else; but emotions aren't logical or analytical — saying “I'm awed” is not the same as saying “Wow!!!”. The Lojban system is intended to give the effects of an analytical system without the thought involved. Thus, you can simply feel in Lojban.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, design benefit">  XE "attitudinals: design benefit"   A nice feature of this design is that you can be simple or complex, and the system works the same way. The most immediate benefit is in learning. You only need to learn a couple of the scale words and a couple of attitude words, and you're ready to express your emotions Lojbanically. As you learn more, you can express your emotions more thoroughly and more precisely, but even a limited vocabulary offers a broad range of expression.
<p>
<a name=s6><h3>Emotional categories</h3>
<p>
<cx "emotional categories">  XE "emotional categories"   <cx "attitudinal categories">  XE "attitudinal categories"   <cx "attitudinal categories, rationale">  XE "attitudinal categories: rationale"   The Lojban attitudinal system was designed by starting with a long list of English emotion words, far too many to fit into the 39 available VV-form cmavo. To keep the number of cmavo limited, the emotion words in the list were grouped together by common features: each group was then assigned a separate cmavo. This was like making tanru in reverse, and the result is a collection of indicators that can be combined, like tanru, to express very complex emotions. Some examples in a moment.
<p>
The most significant “common feature” we identified was that the emotional words on the list could easily be broken down into six major groups, each of which was assigned its own cmavo:
<p>
<lx "ro'a">  XE "ro'a"   <lx "ro'e">  XE "ro'e"   <lx "ro'i">  XE "ro'i"   <lx "ro'o">  XE "ro'o"   <lx "ro'u">  XE "ro'u"   <lx "re'e">  XE "re'e"   <pre>	ro'a	social	asocial	antisocial
	ro'e	mental		mindless
	ro'i	emotional		denying emotion
	ro'o	physical		denying physical
	ro'u	sexual		sexual abstinence
	re'e	spiritual	secular	sacrilegious
</pre><p>Using these, we were able to assign “o'u” to mark a scale of what we might call “generalized comfort”. When you are comfortable, relaxed, satisfied, you express comfort with “o'u”, possibly followed by a scale indicator to indicate how comfortable you are. The six cmavo given above allow you to turn this scale into six separate ones, should you wish.
<p>
<ex "sexual discomfort">  XE "sexual discomfort: example“  <ex "spiritual discomfort">  XE "spiritual discomfort: example“  <ex "embarrassment">  XE "embarrassment: example“  <ex "stress">  XE "stress: example“  <ex "physical distress">  XE "physical distress: example“  <ex "mental discomfort">  XE "mental discomfort: example“  <cx "attitudinal categories, example of effect">  XE "attitudinal categories: example of effect"   For example, embarrassment is a social discomfort, expressible as “.o'unairo'a”. Some emotions that we label “stress” in English are expressed in Lojban with “.o'unairo'i”. Physical distress can be expressed with “.o'unairo'o”, which makes a nice groan if you say it with feeling. Mental discomfort might be what you feel when you don't know the answer to the test question, but feel that you should. Most adults can recall some instance where we felt sexual discomfort, “o'unairo'u”. Spiritual discomfort, “o'unaire'e”, might be felt by a church-goer who has wandered into the wrong kind of religious building.
<p>
Most of the time when expressing an emotion, you won't categorize it with these words. Emotional expressions should be quickly expressible without having to think about them. However, we sometimes have mixed emotions within this set, as for example emotional discomfort coupled with physical comfort or vice versa.
<p>
<lx ".eiro'u">  XE "eiro'u"   Coupling these six words with our 39 attitude scales, each of which has a positive and negative side, already gives you far more emotional expression words than we have emotional labels in English. Thus, you'll never see a Lojban-English emotional dictionary that covers all the Lojban possibilities. Some may be useless, but others convey emotions that probably never had a word for them before, though many have felt them (“.eiro'u”, for example — look it up).
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, categories with scale markers">  XE "attitudinals: categories with scale markers"   <cx "attitudinals, categories with nai">  XE "attitudinals: categories with nai"   <cx "attitudinals, stand-alone categories">  XE "attitudinals: stand-alone categories"   <ex "ro'anai">  XE "ro'anai: example“  You can use scale markers and “nai” on these six category words, and you can also use category words without specifying the emotion. Thus, “I'm trying to concentrate” could be expressed simply as “ro'e”, and if you are feeling anti-social in some non-specific way, “ro'anai” will express it.
<p>
<cx "attitudinal categories, mnemonic for">  XE "attitudinal categories: mnemonic for"   There is a mnemonic device for the six emotion categories, based on moving your arms about. In the following table, your hands begin above your head and move down your body in sequence.
<p>
<pre> 	ro'a	hands above head	social
	ro'e	hands on head	intellectual
	ro'i	hands on heart	emotional
	ro'o	hands on belly	physical
	ro'u	hands on groin	sexual
	re'e	hands moving around	spiritual
</pre><p>The implicit metaphors “heart” for emotional and “belly” for physical are not really Lojbanic, but they work fine for English-speakers.
<p>
<a name=s7><h3>Attitudinal modifiers</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<ex "self-orientation">  XE "self-orientation: example“  <pre>ga'i	[galtu]	hauteur	equal rank	meekness
		rank		lack of rank
le'o		aggressive	passive	defensive
vu'e	[vrude]	virtue (zabna)		sin (mabla)
se'i	[sevzi]	self-orientation		other-orientation
ri'e	[zifre]	release	restraint	control
fu'i	[frili]	with help	without help	with opposition
		easily		with difficulty
be'u		lack	presence	satiation
		need	satisfaction	
se'a	[sevzi]	self-sufficiency		dependency
			
</pre><cx "attitudinal modifiers">  XE "attitudinal modifiers"   It turned out that, once we had devised the six emotion categories, we also recognized some other commonalities among emotions. These tended to fit nicely on scales of their own, but generally tend not to be thought of as separate emotions. Some of these are self-explanatory, some need to be placed in context. Some of these tend to go well with only a few of the attitudinals, others go with nearly all of them. To really understand these modifiers, try to use them in combination with one or two of the attitudinals found in <a href=#s2>Sections 2 </a>and <a href=#s3>3</a>, and see what emotional pictures you can build:
<p>
<ex "inferior">  XE "inferior: example“  <ex "deference">  XE "deference: example“  <ex "condescension">  XE "condescension: example“  <lx "ga'i">  XE "ga'i"   <lx "ga'inai">  XE "ga'inai"   The cmavo “ga'i” expresses the scale used to indicate condescension or polite deference; it is not respect in general, which is “.io”. Whatever it is attached to is marked as being below (for “ga'i”) or above (for “ga'inai”) the speaker's rank or social position. Note that it is always the referent, not the speaker or listener, who is so marked: in order to mark the listener, the listener must appear in the sentence, as with “doi ga'inai”, which can be appended to a statement addressed to a social superior.
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	ko ga'inai nenri klama le mi zdani
	You-imperative [low-rank!] enter-type-of come-to my house.
	I would be honored if you would enter my residence.
</pre><cx "imperatives, attitude">  XE "imperatives: attitude"   Note that imperatives in Lojban need not be imperious! Corresponding examples with “ga'icu'i” and “ga'inai”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d2>7.2)	ko ga'icu'i nenri klama le mi zdani
	You-imperative [equal-rank!] enter-type-of come-to my house.
	Come on in to my place.
<a name=e7d3>7.3)	ko ga'i nenri klama le mi zdani
	You-imperative [high-rank!] enter-type-of come-to my house.
	You! Get inside!
</pre><p>Since “ga'i” expresses the relative rank of the speaker and the referent, it does not make much sense to attach it to “mi”, unless the speaker is using “mi” to refer to a group (as in English “we”), or a past or future version of himself with a different rank.
<p>
It is also possible to attach “ga'i” to a whole bridi, in which case it expresses the speaker's superiority to the event the bridi refers to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d4>7.4)	ga'i le xarju pu citka
	[High-rank!] The pig [past] eats.
	The pig ate (which is an event beneath my notice).
</pre><lx "ga'icai">  XE "ga'icai"   When used without being attached to any bridi, “ga'i” expresses the speaker's superiority to things in general, which may represent an absolute social rank: “ga'icai” is an appropriate opening word for an emperor's address from the throne.
<p>
<lx "le'o">  XE "le'o"   The cmavo “le'o” represents the scale of aggressiveness. We seldom overtly recognize that we are feeling aggressive or defensive, but perhaps in counseling sessions, a psychologist might encourage someone to express these feelings on this scale. And football teams could be urged on by their coach using “ro'ole'o”. “le'o” is also useful in threats as an alternative to “o'onai”, which expresses anger.
<p>
<ex "righteous indignation">  XE "righteous indignation: example“  <lx "vu'e">  XE "vu'e"   <ex "virtue">  XE "virtue: example“  <ex "sinful">  XE "sinful: example“  The cmavo “vu'e” represents ethical virtue or its absence. An excess of almost any emotion is usually somewhat “sinful” in the eyes of most ethical systems. On the other hand, we often feel virtuous about our feelings — what we call righteous indignation might be “o'onaivu'e”. Note that this is distinct from lack of guilt: “.u'unai”.
<p>
<lx "se'i">  XE "se'i"   The cmavo “se'i” expresses the difference between selfishness and generosity, for example (in combination with “.au”):
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d5>7.5)	ause'i
	[desire] [self]
	I want it!
<a name=e7d6>7.6)	ause'inai
	[desire] [other]
	I want you to have it!
</pre><p>In both cases, the English “it” is vague, reflecting the absence of a bridi. <a href=#e7d5>Example 7.5 </a>and <a href=#e7d6>Example 7.6 </a>are pure expressions of attitude. Analogously, “.uuse'i” is self-pity, whereas “.uuse'inai” is pity for someone else.
<p>
<lx "ri'e">  XE "ri'e"   The modifier “ri'e” indicates emotional release versus emotional control. “I will not let him know how angry I am”, you say to yourself before entering the room. The Lojban is much shorter:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d7>7.7)	.o'onai ri'enai
	[anger] [control]
</pre><p>On the other hand, “ri'e” can be used by itself to signal an emotional outburst.
<p>
<lx "fu'i">  XE "fu'i"   The cmavo “fu'i” may express a reason for feeling the way we do, as opposed to a feeling in itself; but it is a reason that is more emotionally determined than most. For example, it could show the difference between the mental discomfort mentioned in <a href=#s6>Section 6 </a>when it is felt on an easy test, as opposed to on a hard test. When someone gives you a back massage, you could use “.o'ufu'i” to show appreciation for the assistance in your comfort.
<p>
<lx "be'u">  XE "be'u"   The cmavo “be'u” expresses, roughly speaking, whether the emotion it modifies is in response to something you don't have enough of, something you have enough of, or something you have too much of. It is more or less the attitudinal equivalent of the subjective quantifier cmavo “mo'a”, “rau”, and “du'e” (these belong to selma'o PA, and are discussed in <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18</a>). For example,
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d8>7.8)	.uiro'obe'unai
	[Yay!] [physical] [Enough!]
</pre><ex "large meal">  XE "large meal: example“  might be something you say after a large meal which you enjoyed.
<p>
Like all modifiers, “be'u” can be used alone:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d9>7.9)	le cukta be'u cu zvati ma
	The book [Needed!] is at-location [what sumti?]
	Where's the book? — I need it!
</pre><lx "se'a">  XE "se'a"   Lastly, the modifier “se'a” shows whether the feeling is associated with self-sufficiency or with dependence on others.
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d10>7.10)	.e'ese'a
	[I can!] [self-sufficient!]
	I can do it all by myself!
</pre>is something a Lojban-speaking child might say. On the other hand,
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d11>7.11)	.e'ese'anai
	[I can!] [dependent]
	I can do it if you help me.
</pre>from the same child would indicate a (hopefully temporary) loss of self- confidence. It is also possible to negate the “.e'e” in <a href=#e7d10>Example 7.10 </a>and <a href=#e7d11>Example 7.11</a>, leading to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d12>7.12)	.e'enaise'a
	[I can't!] [self-sufficient]
	I can't do it if you insist on “helping” me!
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d13>7.13)	.e'enaise'anai
	[I can't!] [dependent]
	I can't do it by myself!
</pre><cx "attitudinals, complexity">  XE "attitudinals: complexity"   Some of the emotional expressions may seem too complicated to use. They might be for most circumstances. It is likely that most combinations will never get used. But if one person uses one of these expressions, another person can understand (as unambiguously as the expresser intends) what emotion is being expressed. Most probably as the system becomes well-known and internalized by Lojban-speakers, particular attitudinal combinations will come to be standard expressions (if not cliches) of emotion.
<p>
<a name=s8><h3>Compound indicators</h3>
<p>
<cx "indicators, grammar for compounding">  XE "indicators: grammar for compounding"   <cx "indicators, meaning when compounded">  XE "indicators: meaning when compounded"   The grammar of indicators is quite simple; almost all facets are optional. You can combine indicators in any order, and they are still grammatical. The presumed denotation is additive; thus the whole is the sum of the parts regardless of the order expressed, although the first expressed is presumed most important to the speaker. Every possible string of UI cmavo has some meaning.
<p>
<cx "unspecified emotion">  XE "unspecified emotion"   <cx "attitudinal indicators, conventions of interpretation">  XE "attitudinal indicators: conventions of interpretation"   <lx "ge'e">  XE "ge'e"   <cx "attitudinal indicator, unspecified">  XE "attitudinal indicator: unspecified"   Within a string of indicators, there will be conventions of interpretation which amount to a kind of second-order grammar. Each of the modifier words is presumed to modify an indicator to the left, if there is one. (There is an “unspecified emotion” word, “ge'e”, reserved to ensure that if you want to express a modifier without a root emotion, it doesn't attach to and modify a previous but distinct emotional expression.)
<p>
<cx "unstated emotion">  XE "unstated emotion"   <cx "unspecified level of emotion">  XE "unspecified level of emotion"   For example, “.ieru'e” expresses a weak positive value on the scale of agreement: the speaker agrees (presumably with the listener or with something else just stated), but with the least possible degree of intensity. But “.ie ge'eru'e” expresses agreement (at an unspecified level), followed by some other unstated emotion which is felt at a weak level. A rough English equivalent of “.ie ge'eru'e” might be “I agree, but <dots>…</dots>” where the “but” is left hanging. (Again, attitudes aren't always expressed in English by English attitudinals.)
<p>
<cx "attitudinal indicators, placement of scale in">  XE "attitudinal indicators: placement of scale in"   A scale variable similarly modifies the previous emotion word. You put the scale word for a root emotion word before a modifier, since the latter can have its own scale word. This merely maximizes the amount of information expressible. For example, “.oinaicu'i ro'ucai” expresses a feeling midway between pain (“.oi”) and pleasure (“.oinai”) which is intensely sexual (“ro'u”) in nature.
<p>
<cx "attitudinal indicators, placement of “nai” in">  XE "attitudinal indicators: placement of \“nai\” in"   <cx "attitudinals, placement in sentences with “nai”">  XE "attitudinals: placement in sentences with \“nai\”"   The cmavo “nai” is the most tightly bound modifier in the language: it always negates exactly one word — the preceding one. Of all the words used in indicator constructs, “nai” is the only one with any meaning outside the indicator system. If you try to put an indicator between a non-indicator cmavo and its “nai” negator, the “nai” will end up negating the last word of the indicator. The result, though unambiguous, is not what you want. For example,
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d1>8.1)	mi .e .ui nai do
	I and [Yay!] [Not!] you
</pre>means “I and (unfortunately) you”, whereas
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d2>8.2)	mi .e nai .ui do
	I and [Not!] [Yay!] you
</pre>means “I but (fortunately) not you”. Attitudinal “nai” expresses a “scalar negation”, a concept explained in <a href=chap15.html>Chapter 15</a>; since every attitudinal word implies exactly one scale, the effect of “nai” on each should be obvious.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, internal grammar, complete">  XE "attitudinals: internal grammar, complete"   <cx "attitudinals, grammar of internal compounding">  XE "attitudinals: grammar of internal compounding"   Thus, the complete internal grammar of UI is as follows, with each listed part optionally present or absent without affecting grammaticality, though it obviously would affect meaning.
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>attitudinal  “nai”  intensity-word  “nai”  modifier  “nai”  intensity-word  “nai”
		(possibly repeated)
</dl>“ge'e”, the non-specific emotion word, functions as an attitudinal. If multiple attitudes are being expressed at once, then in the 2nd or greater position, either “ge'e” or a VV word must be used to prevent any modifiers from modifying the previous attitudinal.

<p>
<a name=s9><h3>The uses of indicators</h3>
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, grammar of placement in bridi">  XE "attitudinals: grammar of placement in bridi"   <cx "attitudinals, external grammar">  XE "attitudinals: external grammar"   <lx "si">  XE "si"   <lx "sa">  XE "sa"   <lx "su">  XE "su"   The behavior of indicators in the “outside grammar” is nearly as simple as their internal structure. Indicator groupings are identified immediately after the metalinguistic erasers “si”, “sa”, and “su” and some, though not all, kinds of quotations. The details of such interactions are discussed in <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19</a>.
<p>
<lx "zo">  XE "zo"   A group of indicators may appear anywhere that a single indicator may, except in those few situations (as in “zo” quotation, explained in <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19</a>) where compound cmavo may not be used.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, at beginning of text">  XE "attitudinals: at beginning of text"   At the beginning of a text, indicators modify everything following them indefinitely: such a usage is taken as a raw emotional expression, and we normally don't turn off our emotions when we start and stop sentences. In every other place in an utterance, the indicator (or group) attaches to the word immediately to its left, and indicates that the attitude is being expressed concerning the object or concept to which the word refers.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, affecting whole grammatical structures">  XE "attitudinals: affecting whole grammatical structures"   If the word that an indicator (or group) attaches to is itself a cmavo which governs a grammatical structure, then the indicator construct pertains to the referent of the entire structure. There is also a mechanism, discussed in <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19</a>, for explicitly marking the range of words to which an indicator applies.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, referent uncertainty">  XE "attitudinals: referent uncertainty"   More details about the uses of indicators, and the way they interact with other specialized cmavo, are given in <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19</a>. It is worth mentioning that real-world interpretation is not necessarily consistent with the formal scope rules. People generally express emotions when they feel them, with only a minimum of grammatical constraint on that expression; complexities of emotional expression are seldom logically analyzable. Lojban attempts to provide a systematic reference that could possibly be ingrained to an instinctive level. However, it should always be assumed that the referent of an indicator has some uncertainty.
<p>
<cx "multiple indicators">  XE "multiple indicators"   For example, in cases of multiple indicators expressed together, the combined form has some ambiguity of interpretation. It is possible to interpret the second indicator as expressing an attitude about the first, or to interpret both as expressing attitudes about the common referent. For example, in
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	mi pu tavla do .o'onai .oi
	I [past] talk-to you [Grrr!] [Oy!]
</pre>can be interpreted as expressing complaint about the anger, in which case it means “Damn, I snapped at you”; or as expressing both anger and complaint about the listener, in which case it means “I told you, you pest!”
<p>
Similarly, an indicator after the final brivla of a tanru may be taken to express an attitude about the particular brivla placed there — as the rules have it — or about the entire bridi which hinges on that brivla. Remembering that indicators are supposedly direct expressions of emotion, this ambiguity is acceptable.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, benefit in written expression">  XE "attitudinals: benefit in written expression"   Even if the scope rules given for indicators turn out to be impractical or unintuitive for use in conversation, they are still useful in written expression. There, where you can go back and put in markers or move words around, the scope rules can be used in lieu of elaborate nuances of body language and intonation to convey the writer's intent.

<p>
<a name=s10><h3>Attitude questions; empathy; attitude contours</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	pei	attitude question
	dai	empathy
	bu'o	start emotion	continue emotion	end emotion
</pre><p>You can ask someone how they are feeling with a normal bridi sentence, but you will get a normal bridi answer in response, one which may be true or false. Since the response to a question about emotions is no more logical than the emotion itself, this isn't appropriate.
<p>
<lx "pei">  XE "pei"   <cx "attitudinal questions">  XE "attitudinal questions"   The word “pei” is therefore reserved for attitude questions. Asked by itself, it captures all of the denotation of English “How are you?” coupled with “How do you feel?” (which has a slightly different range of usage).
<p>
<cx "attitudinal answers, plausibility">  XE "attitudinal answers: plausibility"   When asked in the context of discourse, “pei” acts like other Lojban question words — it requests the respondent to “fill in the blank”, in this case with an appropriate attitudinal describing the respondent's feeling about the referent expression. As with other questions, plausibility is polite; if you answer with an irrelevant UI cmavo, such as a discursive, you are probably making fun of the questioner. (A “ge'e”, however, is always in order — you are not required to answer emotionally. This is not the same as “.i'inai”, which is privacy as the reverse of conviviality.)
<p>
<cx "attitudinal questions, asking intensity">  XE "attitudinal questions: asking intensity"   Most often, however, the asker will use “pei” as a place holder for an intensity marker. (As a result, “pei” is placed in selma'o CAI, although selma'o UI would have been almost as appropriate. Grammatically, there is no difference between UI and CAI.) Such usage corresponds to a whole range of idiomatic usages in natural languages:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d1>10.1)	.iepei
	[agreement] [question]
	Do you agree?
<a name=e10d2>10.2)	.iare'epei
	[belief] [spiritual] [question]
	Are you a Believer?
<a name=e10d3>10.3)	.aipei
	[intention] [question]
	Are you going to do it?
</pre><a href=#e10d3>Example 10.3 </a>might appear at the end of a command, to which the response
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d4>10.4)	.aicai
	[intention] [maximal]
</pre>corresponds to “Aye! Aye!” (hence the choice of cmavo).
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d5>10.5)	.e'apei
	[permission] [question]
	Please, Mommy! Can I??
</pre><cx "attitudinal questions, asking about specific attitude">  XE "attitudinal questions: asking about specific attitude"   Additionally, when “pei” is used at the beginning of an indicator construct, it asks specifically if that construct reflects the attitude of the respondent, as in (asked of someone who has been ill or in pain):
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d6>10.6)	pei.o'u
	[question] [comfort]
	Are you comfortable?
<a name=e10d7>10.7)	pei.o'ucu'i
	[question] [comfort] [neutral]
	Are you no longer in pain?
<a name=e10d8>10.8)	pei.o'usai
	[question] [comfort] [strong]
	Are you again healthy?

(Don't confuse empathy with sympathy, which is “.uuse'inai”.) Sometimes, as when telling a story, you want to attribute emotion to someone else. You can of course make a bridi claim that so-and-so felt such-and-such an emotion, but you can also make use of the attitudinal system by adding the indicator “dai”, which attributes the preceding attitudinal to someone else — exactly whom, must be determined from context. You can also use “dai” conversationally when you empathize, or feel someone else's emotion as if it were your own:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d9>10.9)	.oiro'odai
	[Pain!] [physical] [empathy]
	Ouch, that must have hurt!
</pre><p>It is even possible to “empathize” with a non-living object:
<p>
<ex "ship sank">  XE "ship sank: example“  <pre><a name=e10d10>10.10)	le bloti .iidai .uu pu klama le xasloi
	The ship [fear!] [empathy] [pity!] [past] goes-to the ocean-floor
	Fearfully the ship, poor thing, sank.
</pre>suggesting that the ship felt fear at its impending destruction, and simultaneously reporting the speaker's pity for it.
<p>
<cx "attitudinals, exceptions">  XE "attitudinals: exceptions"   <cx "attitudinals, non-speaker attitudes">  XE "attitudinals: non-speaker attitudes"   Both “pei” and “dai” represent exceptions to the normal rule that attitudinals reflect the speaker's attitude.
<p>
<cx "attitudes, expressing changes in">  XE "attitudes: expressing changes in"   <cx "attitudinals, contours">  XE "attitudinals: contours"   <cx "attitudes, continuing">  XE "attitudes: continuing"   <cx "attitudes, beginning">  XE "attitudes: beginning"   <cx "attitudes, ceasing">  XE "attitudes: ceasing"   <lx "bu'o">  XE "bu'o"   <lx "bu'onai">  XE "bu'onai"   Finally, we often want to report how our attitudes are changing. If our attitude has not changed, we can just repeat the attitudinal. (Therefore, “.ui .ui .ui” is not the same as “.uicai”, but simply means that we are continuing to be happy.) If we want to report that we are beginning to feel, continuing to feel, or ceasing to feel an emotion, we can use the attitudinal contour cmavo “bu'o”.
<p>
When attached to an attitudinal, “bu'o” means that you are starting to have that attitude, “bu'ocu'i” that you are continuing to have it, and “bu'onai” that you are ceasing to have it. Some examples:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d11>10.11)	o'onai bu'o
	[Anger!] [start emotion]
	I'm getting angry!
<a name=e10d12>10.12)	.iu bu'onai .uinai
	[Love!] [end emotion] [unhappiness!]
	I don't love you any more; I'm sad.

</pre><p>Note the difference in effect between <a href=#e10d12>Example 10.12 </a>and:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d13>10.13)	mi ca ba'o prami do ja'e le nu mi badri
	I [present] [cessitive] love you with-result the event-of (I am-sad).
	I no longer love you; therefore, I am sad.
</pre>which is a straightforward bridi claim. <a href=#e10d13>Example 10.13 </a>states that you have (or have had) certain emotions; <a href=#e10d12>Example 10.12 </a>expresses those emotions directly.

<a name=s11><h3>Evidentials</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>

su'a	[sucta]	I generalize		I particularize

</pre><cx "Elgin, Suzette Haden and evidentials">  XE "Elgin: Suzette Haden and evidentials"   <cx "American Indian languages and evidentials">  XE "American Indian languages and evidentials"   <cx "Lá&aacute;adan evidentials"><cx "evidentials, definition">  XE "evidentials: definition"   <cx "evidentials, inspiration for">  XE "evidentials: inspiration for"   Now we proceed from the attitudinal indicators and their relatives to the other, semantically unrelated, categories of indicators. The indicators known as “evidentials” show how the speaker came to say the utterance; i.e. the source of the information or the idea. Lojban's list of evidentials was derived from lists describing several American Indian languages. Evidentials are also essential to the constructed language Lá&aacute;adan, designed by the linguist and novelist Suzette Haden Elgin. Lá&aacute;adan's set of indicators was drawn on extensively in developing the Lojban indicator system.
<p>
<cx "evidentials in English">  XE "evidentials: in English"   It is important to realize, however, that evidentials are not some odd system used by some strange people who live at the other end of nowhere: although their English equivalents aren't single words, English-speakers have vivid notions of what constitutes evidence, and of the different kinds of evidence.
<p>
<cx "evidentials, grammar">  XE "evidentials: grammar"   <cx "evidentials, scales">  XE "evidentials: scales"   Like the attitudinal indicators, the evidentials belong to selma'o UI, and may be treated identically for grammatical purposes. Most of them are not usually considered scalar in nature, but a few have associated scales.
<p>
<cx "indisputable bridi">  XE "indisputable bridi"   <cx "evidential, indisputable bridi">  XE "evidentials: indisputable bridi"   <cx "evidential, rhetorical flavor">  XE "evidentials: rhetorical flavor"   A bridi with an evidential in it becomes “indisputable”, in the sense that the speaker is saying “how it is with him or her”, which is beyond argument. Claims about one's own mental states may be true or false, but are hardly subject to other people's examination. If you say that you think, or perceive, or postulate such-and-such a predication, who can contradict you? Discourse that uses evidentials has therefore a different rhetorical flavor than discourse that does not; arguments tend to become what can be called dialogues or alternating monologues, depending on your prejudices.
<p>
<cx "evidentials, placement in bridi">  XE "evidentials: placement in bridi"   Evidentials are most often placed at the beginning of sentences, and are often attached to the “.i” that separates sentences in connected discourse. It is in the nature of an evidential to affect the entire bridi in which it is placed: like the propositional attitude indicators, they strongly affect the claim made by the main bridi.
<p>
<lx "ja'o">  XE "ja'o"   <ex "thus">  XE "thus: example“  <ex "deduction">  XE "deduction: example“  A bridi marked by “ja'o” is a conclusion by the speaker based on other (stated or unstated) information or ideas. Rough English equivalents of “ja'o” are “thus” and “therefore”.
<p>
<ex "husband and wife">  XE "husband and wife: example“  <lx "ca'e">  XE "ca'e"   <ex "pronouncement">  XE "pronouncement: example“  A bridi marked by “ca'e” is true because the speaker says so. In addition to definitions of words, “ca'e” is also appropriate in what are called performatives, where the very act of speaking the words makes them true. An English example is “I now pronounce you husband and wife”, where the very act of uttering the words makes the listeners into husband and wife. A Lojban translation might be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d1>11.1)	ca'e le re do cu simxu speni
	[I define!] The two of-you are-mutual spouses.
</pre><lx "ba'a">  XE "ba'a"   <lx "ba'acu'i">  XE "ba'acu'i"   <lx "ba'anai">  XE "ba'anai"   <cx "evidentials, ba'a scale">  XE "evidentials: ba'a scale"   <ex "anticipated">  XE "anticipated: example“  <ex "remembered">  XE "remembered: example“  <ex "experienced">  XE "experienced: example“  The three scale positions of “ba'a”, when attached to a bridi, indicate that it is based on the speaker's view of the real world. Thus “ba'a” means that the statement represents a future event as anticipated by the speaker; “ba'acu'i”, a present event as experienced by the speaker; “ba'anai”, a past event as remembered by the speaker. It is accidental that this scale runs from future to past instead of past to future.
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d2>11.2)	ba'acu'i le tuple be mi cu se cortu
	[I experience!] The leg of me is-the-locus-of-pain.
	My leg hurts.
</pre><ex "induction">  XE "induction: example“  <lx "su'a">  XE "su'a"   <cx "evidentials, su'a contrasted with ja'o">  XE "evidentials: su'a contrasted with ja'o"   <cx "evidentials, ja'o contrasted with su'a">  XE "evidentials: ja'o contrasted with su'a"   A bridi marked by “su'a” is a generalization by the speaker based on other (stated or unstated) information or ideas. The difference between “su'a” and “ja'o” is that “ja'o” suggests some sort of reasoning or deduction (not necessarily rigorous), whereas “su'a” suggests some sort of induction or pattern recognition from existing examples (not necessarily rigorous).
<p>
<ex "abduction">  XE "abduction: example“  <lx "su'anai">  XE "su'anai"   The opposite point of the scale, “su'anai”, indicates abduction, or drawing specific conclusions from general premises or patterns.
<p>
<cx "discursive, su'a as">  XE "discursives: su'a"   This cmavo can also function as a discursive (see <a href=#s12>Section 12</a>), in which case “su'a” means “abstractly” or “in general”, and “su'anai” means “concretely” or “in particular”.
<p>
<lx "ti'e">  XE "ti'e"   <ex "hearsay">  XE "hearsay: example“  A bridi marked by “ti'e” is relayed information from some source other than the speaker. There is no necessary implication that the information was relayed via the speaker's ears; what we read in a newspaper is an equally good example of “ti'e”, unless we have personal knowledge of the content.
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d3>11.3)	ti'e la .uengas cu zergau
	[I hear!] Wenga is-a-criminal-doer.
	I hear that Wenga is a crook.
</pre><ex "myth">  XE "myth: example“  <lx "ka'u">  XE "ka'u"   <ex "cultural knowledge">  XE "cultural knowledge: example“  A bridi marked by “ka'u” is one held to be true in the speaker's cultural context, as a matter of myth or custom, for example. Such statements should be agreed on by a community of people — you cannot just make up your own cultural context — although “objectivity” in the sense of actual correspondence with the facts is certainly not required.
<p>
<ex "revelation">  XE "revelation: example“  <ex "dream">  XE "dream: example“  <lx "se'o">  XE "se'o"   <lx "ka'u">  XE "ka'u"   <cx "evidentials, se'o contrasted with ka'u">  XE "evidentials: se'o contrasted with ka'u"   <cx "evidentials, ka'u contrasted with se'o">  XE "evidentials: ka'u contrasted with se'o"   On the other hand, “se'o” marks a bridi whose truth is asserted by the speaker as a result of an internal experience not directly available to others, such as a dream, vision, or personal revelation. In some cultures, the line between “ka'u” and “se'o” is fuzzy or even nonexistent.
<p>
<lx "za'a">  XE "za'a"   <ex "observation">  XE "observation: example“  <cx "observative, contrasted with observation evidential">  XE "observative: contrasted with observation evidential"   <cx "observation evidential, contrasted with observative ">  XE "observation evidential: contrasted with observative "   A bridi marked by “za'a” is based on perception or direct observation by the speaker. This use of “observe” is not connected with the Lojban “observative”, or bridi with the first sumti omitted. The latter has no explicit aspect, and could be a direct observation, a conclusion, an opinion, or other aspectual point of view.
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d4>11.4)	za'a do tatpi
	[I observe!] You are-tired.
	I see you are tired.
</pre><lx "pe'i">  XE "pe'i"   <ex "opinion">  XE "opinion: example“  <lx "pe'ipei">  XE "pe'ipei"   A bridi marked by “pe'i” is the opinion of the speaker. The form “pe'ipei” is common, meaning “Is this your opinion?”. (Strictly, this should be “peipe'i”, in accordance with the distinction explained in Examples 10.6-10.8, but since “pe'i” is not really a scale, there is no real difference between the two orders.)
<p>
<ex "Carthage destroyed">  XE "Carthage destroyed: example“  <pre><a name=e11d5>11.5)	pe'i la kartagos. .ei se daspo
	[I opine!] Carthage [obligation] is-destroyed.
	In my opinion, Carthage should be destroyed.
</pre><lx "ru'a">  XE "ru'a"   <cx "ru'a, compared with e'u">  XE "ru'a: compared with e'u"   <cx "e'u, compared with ru'a">  XE "e'u: compared with ru'a"   <lx "e'u">  XE "e'u"   <ex "assumption">  XE "assumption: example“  A bridi marked by “ru'a” is an assumption made by the speaker. This is similar to one possible use of “.e'u”.
<p>
<ex "Livingston">  XE "Livingston: example“  <pre><a name=e11d6>11.6)	ru'a doi livinston.
	Dr. Livingstone, I presume?  
		(A rhetorical question:  Stanley knew who he was.)
</pre><lx "ju'a">  XE "ju'a"   <ex "basis">  XE "basis: example“  <lx "ju'apei">  XE "ju'apei"   Finally, the evidential “ju'a” is used to avoid stating a specific basis for a statement. It can also be used when the basis for the speaker's statement is not covered by any other evidential. For the most part, using “ju'a” is equivalent to using no evidential at all, but in question form it can be useful: “ju'apei” means “What is the basis for your statement?” and serves as an evidential, as distinct from emotional, question.
<p>
<a name=s12><h3>Discursives</h3>
<p>
<cx "discursive, definition">  XE "discursives: definition"   <cx "utterance, expressing relation to discourse">  XE "utterance: expressing relation to discourse"   <cx "discourse, expressing utterance relation to">  XE "discourse: expressing utterance relation to"   The term “discursive” is used for those members of selma'o UI that provide structure to the discourse, and which show how a given word or utterance relates to the whole discourse. To express these concepts in regular bridi would involve extra layers of nesting: rather than asserting that “I also came”, we would have to say “I came; furthermore, the event of my coming is an additional instance of the relationship expressed by the previous sentence”, which is intolerably clumsy. Typical English equivalents of discursives are words or phrases like “however”, “summarizing”, “in conclusion”, and “for example”.
<p>
<cx "discursives, contrasted with attitudinals">  XE "discursives: contrasted with attitudinals"   <cx "attitudinals, contrasted with discursives">  XE "attitudinals: contrasted with discursives"   <cx "discursives, as metalinguistic claims">  XE "discursives: as metalinguistic claims"   Discursives are not attitudinals: they express no particular emotion. Rather, they are abbreviations for metalinguistic claims that reference the sentence or text they are found in.
<p>
<cx "discursives, placement in sentence">  XE "discursives: placement in sentence"   Discursives are most often used at the beginning of sentences, often attached to the “.i” that separates sentences in running discourse, but can (like all other indicators) be attached to single words when it seems necessary or useful.
<p>
<cx "discursives for consecutive discourse">  XE "discursives for consecutive discourse"   The discursives discussed in this section are given in groups, roughly organized by function. First, the “consecutive discourse” group:
<p>
<lx "ku'i">  XE "ku'i"   <lx "ji'a">  XE "ji'a"   <lx "si'a">  XE "si'a"   <lx "mi'u">  XE "mi'u"   <lx "po'o">  XE "po'o"   <pre>ku'i	[karbi]	however/but/in contrast	
ji'a	[jmina]	additionally		
si'a	[simsa]	similarly		
mi'u	[mintu]	ditto		
po'o		the only relevant case
</pre><cx "discursives for consecutive discourse, contrasted">  XE "discursives for consecutive discourse: contrasted"   <cx "mi'u, contrasted with go'i">  XE "mi'u: contrasted with go'i"   <cx "go'i, contrasted with mi'u">  XE "go'i: contrasted with mi'u"   <lx "go'i">  XE "go'i"   <ex "ditto">  XE "ditto: example“  <ex "but">  XE "but: example“  <ex "too">  XE "too: example“  These five discursives are mutually exclusive, and therefore they are not usually considered as scales. The first four are used in consecutive discourse. The first, “ku'i”, makes an exception to the previous argument. The second, “ji'a”, adds weight to the previous argument. The third, “si'a”, adds quantity to the previous argument, enumerating an additional example. The fourth, “mi'u”, adds a parallel case to the previous argument, and can also be used in tables or the like to show that something is being repeated from the previous column. It is distinct from “go'i” (of selma'o GOhA, discussed in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7</a>), which is a non-discursive version of “ditto” that explicitly repeats the claim of the previous bridi.
<p>
<ex "only">  XE "only: example“  Lastly, “po'o” is used when there is no other comparable case, and thus corresponds to some of the uses of “only”, a word difficult to express in pure bridi form:
<p>
<ex "hit cousin">  XE "hit cousin: example“  <ex "hit nose">  XE "hit nose: example“  <pre><a name=e12d1>12.1)	mi po'o darxi le mi tamne fo le nazbi
	I [only] hit my cousin at-locus the nose.
	Only I (nobody else) hit my cousin on his nose.
<a name=e12d2>12.2)	mi darxi po'o le mi tamne fo le nazbi
	I hit [only] my cousin at-locus the nose.
	I only hit my cousin on his nose (I did nothing else to him).
<a name=e12d3>12.3)	mi darxi le mi tamne po'o fo le nazbi
	I hit my cousin [only] at-locus the nose.
	I hit only my cousin on his nose (no one else).
<a name=e12d4>12.4)	mi darxi le mi tamne fo le nazbi po'o
	I hit my cousin at-locus the nose [only].
	I hit my cousin only on his nose (nowhere else).
</pre><cx "po'o, placement in sentence">  XE "po'o: placement in sentence"   Note that “only” can go before or after what it modifies in English, but “po'o”, as an indicator, always comes afterward.
<p>
Next, the “commentary on words” group:
<p>
<lx "va'i">  XE "va'i"   <lx "ta'u">  XE "ta'u"   <pre>va'i	[valsi]	in other words		in the same words
ta'u	[tanru]	expanding a tanru	making a tanru
</pre><cx "discursives, word-level">  XE "discursives: word-level"   <cx "discursives, expressing how things are said">  XE "discursives: expressing how things are said"   The discursives “va'i” and “ta'u” operate at the level of words, rather than discourse proper, or if you like, they deal with how things are said. An alternative English expression for “va'i” is “rephrasing”; for “va'inai”, “repeating”. Also compare “va'i” with “ke'u”, discussed below.
<p>
<cx "tanru, expanding">  XE "tanru: expanding"   <cx "tanru, explicating">  XE "tanru: explicating"   <cx "tanru, explicitly defining">  XE "tanru: explicitly defining"   <lx "ta'unai">  XE "ta'unai"   The cmavo “ta'u” is a discursive unique to Lojban; it expresses the particularly Lojbanic device of tanru. Since tanru are semantically ambiguous, they are subject to misunderstanding. This ambiguity can be removed by expanding the tanru into some semantically unambiguous structure, often involving relative clauses or the introduction of additional brivla. The discursive “ta'u” marks the transition from the use of a brief but possibly confusing tanru to its fuller, clearer expansion; the discursive “ta'unai” marks a transition in the reverse direction.
<p>
Next, the “commentary on discourse” group:
<p>
<lx "li'a">  XE "li'a"   <lx "ba'u">  XE "ba'u"   <lx "zo'o">  XE "zo'o"   <lx "sa'e">  XE "sa'e"   <lx "to'u">  XE "to'u"   <lx "do'a">  XE "do'a"   <lx "sa'u">  XE "sa'u"   <lx "pa'e">  XE "pa'e"   <lx "ge'u">  XE "ge'u"   <pre> li'a	[klina]	clearly		obscurely

sa'u	[sampu]	simply		elaborating
pa'e	[pajni]	justice		prejudice
je'u	[jetnu]	truly		falsely
</pre><lx "zo'o">  XE "zo'o"   <cx "discursives, discourse commentary">  XE "discursives: discourse commentary"   <cx "discourse, commentary on">  XE "discourse: commentary on"   <cx "discourse, tone of voice markers">  XE "discourse: tone of voice markers"   <cx "discourse, gesture markers">  XE "discourse: gesture markers"   This group is used by the speaker to characterize the nature of the discourse, so as to prevent misunderstanding. It is well-known that listeners often fail to recognize a humorous statement and take it seriously, or miss an exaggeration, or try to read more into a statement than the speaker intends to put there. In speech, the tone of voice often provides the necessary cue, but the reader of ironic or understated or imprecise discourse is often simply clueless. As with the attitudinals, the use of these cmavo may seem fussy to new Lojbanists, but it is important to remember that “zo'o”, for example, is the equivalent of smiling while you speak, not the equivalent of a flat declaration like “What I'm about to say is supposed to be funny.”
<p>
<lx "sa'enai">  XE "sa'enai"   A few additional English equivalents: for “sa'enai”, “roughly speaking” or “approximately speaking”; for “sa'unai”, “furthermore”; for “to'u”, “in short” or “skipping details”; for “do'a”, “broadly construed”; for “do'anai” (as you might expect), “narrowly construed”.
<p>
<lx "pa'e">  XE "pa'e"   <lx "pa'enai">  XE "pa'enai"   The cmavo “pa'e” is used to claim (truly or falsely) that one is being fair or just to all parties mentioned, whereas “pa'enai” admits (or proclaims) a bias in favor of one party.
<p>
<ex "sarcasm">  XE "sarcasm: example“  <ex "irony">  XE "irony: example“  <cx "sarcasm, expressing">  XE "sarcasm: expressing"   <cx "irony, expressing">  XE "irony: expressing"   <lx "zo'o">  XE "zo'o"   <lx ".ianai">  XE "ianai"   The scale of “je'u” and “je'unai” is a little different from the others in the group. By default, we assume that people speak the truth — or at least, that if they are lying, they will do their best to conceal it from us. So under what circumstances would “je'unai” be used, or “je'u” be useful? For one thing, “je'u” can be used to mark a tautology: a sentence that is a truth of logic, like “All cats are cats.” Its counterpart “je'unai” then serves to mark a logical contradiction. In addition, “je'unai” can be used to express one kind of sarcasm or irony, where the speaker pretends to believe what he/she says, but actually wishes the listener to infer a contrary opinion. Other forms of irony can be marked with “zo'o” (humor) or “.ianai” (disbelief).
<p>
<lx "su'a">  XE "su'a"   When used as a discursive, “su'a” (see <a href=#s11>Section 11</a>) belongs to this group.
<p>
Next, the “knowledge” group:
<p>
<cx "knowledge discursives">  XE "knowledge discursives"   <cx "discursives, knowledge">  XE "discursives: knowledge"   <lx "ju'o">  XE "ju'o"   <lx "la'a">  XE "la'a"   <pre>ju'o	[djuno]	certainly	uncertain	certainly not
la'a	[lakne]	probably		improbably
</pre><cx "speaker's state of knowledge">  XE "speaker's state of knowledge"   <cx "propositional attitudes, compared with knowledge discursives">  XE "propositional attitudes: compared with knowledge discursives"   <cx "knowledge discursives, compared with propositional attitudes">  XE "knowledge discursives: compared with propositional attitudes"   These two discursives describe the speaker's state of knowledge about the claim of the associated bridi. They are similar to the propositional attitudes of <a href=#s3>Section 3</a>, as they create a hypothetical world. We may be quite certain that something is true, and label our bridi with “ju'o”; but it may be false all the same.
<p>
Next, the “discourse management” group:
<p>
<lx "ta'o">  XE "ta'o"   <lx "ra'u">  XE "ra'u"   <lx "mu'a">  XE "mu'a"   <lx "zu'u">  XE "zu'u"   <lx "ke'u">  XE "ke'u"   <lx "da'i">  XE "da'i"   <pre>ta'o	[tanjo]	by the way		returning to point

</pre><cx "discursives, discourse management">  XE "discursives: discourse management"   <cx "discursives for managing discourse flow">  XE "discursives for managing discourse flow"   <cx "flow of discourse, managing with discursives">  XE "flow of discourse: managing with discursives"   This final group is used to perform what may be called “managing the discourse”: providing reference points to help the listener understand the flow from one sentence to the next.
<p>
<lx "ta'onao">  XE "ta'onao"   Other English equivalents of “ta'onai” are “anyway”, “anyhow”, “in any case”, “in any event”, “as I was saying”, and “continuing”.
<p>
<cx "importance of point, scale with ra'u">  XE "importance of point: scale with ra'u"   <cx "ra'u, scale of importance">  XE "ra'u: scale of importance"   The scale of “ra'u” has to do with the importance of the point being, or about to be, expressed: “ra'u” is the most important point, “ra'ucu'i” is a point of equal importance, and “ra'unai” is a lesser point. Other English equivalents of “ra'u” are “above all” and “primarily”.
<p>
<cx "va'i, contrasted with ke'u">  XE "va'i: contrasted with ke'u"   <cx "ke'u, contrasted with va'i">  XE "ke'u: contrasted with va'i"   <lx "va'i">  XE "va'i"   <lx "va'inai">  XE "va'inai"   <lx "ke'unai">  XE "ke'unai"   The cmavo “ke'u” is very similar to “va'i”, although “ke'unai” and “va'inai” are quite different. Both “ke'u” and “va'i” indicate that the same idea is going to be expressed using different words, but the two cmavo differ in emphasis. Using “ke'u” emphasizes that the content is the same; using “va'i” emphasizes that the words are different. Therefore, “ke'unai” shows that the content is new (and therefore the words are also); “va'inai” shows that the words are the same (and therefore so is the content). One English equivalent of “ke'unai” is “furthermore”.

<cx "real world point of view">  XE "real world point of view"   <cx "hypothetical world point of view">  XE "hypothetical world point of view"   <cx "if, expressing hypothetical world">  XE “if, expressing hypothetical world"   <cx "if, expressing real world">  XE “if: expressing real world"   The discursive “da'i” marks the discourse as possibly taking a non-real-world viewpoint (“Supposing that”, “By hypothesis”), whereas “da'inai” insists on the real-world point of view (“In fact”, “In truth”, “According to the facts”). A common use of “da'i” is to distinguish between:
<p>
<ex "sister pregnant">  XE "sister pregnant: example“  <ex "pregnant sister">  XE "pregnant sister: example“  <cx "real world, contrasted with hypothetical world, example">  XE "real world: contrasted with hypothetical world, example"   <cx "hypothetical world, contrasted with real world, example">  XE "hypothetical world: contrasted with real world, example"   <pre><a name=e12d5>12.5)	ganai da'i do viska le mi citno mensi gi ju'o do djuno

<a name=s13><h3>Miscellaneous indicators</h3>
<p>
Some indicators do not fall neatly into the categories of attitudinal, evidential, or discursive. This section discusses the following miscellaneous indicators:
<p>
<pre> 	ki'a	metalinguistic confusion
	na'i	metalinguistic negator
	jo'a	metalinguistic affirmer
	li'o	omitted text (quoted material)
	sa'a	material inserted by editor/narrator
	xu	true-false question
	pau	question premarker			rhetorical question
	pe'a	figurative language			literal language
	bi'u	new information			old information
	ge'e	non-specific indicator
</pre><lx "ki'a">  XE "ki'a"   <ex "huh?">  XE "huh?: example“   <cx "confusion, metalinguistic">  XE "confusion: metalinguistic"   <cx "confusion about what was said">  XE "confusion about what was said"   The cmavo “ki'a” is one of the most common of the miscellaneous indicators. It expresses metalinguistic confusion; i.e. confusion about what has been said, as opposed to confusion not tied to the discourse (which is “.uanai”). The confusion may be about the meaning of a word or of a grammatical construct, or about the referent of a sumti. One of the uses of English “which” corresponds to “ki'a”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d1>13.1)	mi nelci le ctuca
.i le ki'a ctuca
	I like the teacher
	Which teacher?
</pre><p>Here, the second speaker does not understand the referent of the sumti “le ctuca”, and so echoes back the sumti with the confusion marker.
<p>
<lx "na'i">  XE "na'i"   <lx "jo'a">  XE "jo'a"   <cx "error marking, metalinguistic">  XE "error marking: metalinguistic"   <cx "invalid speech, marking as error with na'i">  XE "invalid speech: marking as error with na'i"   The metalinguistic negation cmavo “na'i” and its opposite “jo'a” are explained in full in <a href=chap15.html>Chapter 15</a>. In general, “na'i” indicates that there is something wrong with a piece of discourse: either an error, or a false underlying assumption, or something else of the sort. The discourse is invalid or inappropriate due to the marked word or construct.
<p>
<cx "valid speech, marking as error with jo'a">  XE "valid speech: marking as error with jo'a"   Similarly, “jo'a” marks something which looks wrong but is in fact correct. These two cmavo constitute a scale, but are kept apart for two reasons: “na'inai” means the same as “jo'a”, but would be too confusing as an affirmation; “jo'anai” means the same as “na'i”, but is too long to serve as a convenient metalinguistic negator.
<p>
<cx "fragmentary text">  XE "fragmentary text"   <lx "li'o">  XE "li'o"   <cx "partial quotation">  XE "partial quotation"   The next two cmavo are used to assist in quoting texts written or spoken by others. It is often the case that we wish to quote only part of a text, or to supply additional material either by way of commentary or to make a fragmentary text grammatical. The cmavo “li'o” serves the former function. It indicates that words were omitted from the quotation. What remains of the quotation must be grammatical, however, as “li'o” does not serve any grammatical function. It cannot, for example, take the place of a missing selbri in a bridi, or supply the missing tail of a description sumti: “le li'o” in isolation is not grammatical.
<p>
<lx "sa'a">  XE "sa'a"   <cx "editorial insertion, with "sa'a">  XE "editorial insertion: with sa'a"   <lx "sei">  XE "sei"   <lx "to'i">  XE "to'i"   <cx "sa'a, interaction with li'o">  XE "sa'a: interaction with li'o"   <cx "sa'a, interaction with sei">  XE "sa'a: interaction with sei"   <cx "sa'a, interaction with to'i">  XE "sa'a: interaction with to'i"   The cmavo “sa'a” indicates in a quotation that the marked word or construct was not actually expressed, but is inserted for editorial, narrative, or grammatical purposes. Strictly, even a “li'o” should appear in the form “li'osa'a”, since the “li'o” was not part of the original quotation. In practice, this and other forms which are already associated with metalinguistic expressions, such as “sei” (of selma'o SEI) or “to'i” (of selma'o TO) need not be marked except where confusion might result.
<p>
<cx "editorial insertion, of text already containing sa'a">  XE "editorial insertion: of text already containing sa'a"   <cx "sa'a, editorial insertion of text already containing sa'a">  XE "sa'a: editorial insertion of text already containing sa'a"   In the rare case that the quoted material already contains one or more instances of “sa'a”, they can be changed to “sa'asa'a”.
<p>
<lx "xu">  XE "xu"   <cx "yes/no questions">  XE "yes/no questions"   <cx "truth questions">  XE "truth questions"   <cx "questions, with "xu">  XE "questions: with \"xu"   The cmavo “xu” marks truth questions, which are discussed in detail in <a href=chap15.html>Chapter 15</a>. In general, “xu” may be translated “Is it true that <dots>…</dots>?” and questions whether the attached bridi is true. When “xu” is attached to a specific word or construct, it directs the focus of the question to that word or construct.
<p>
<lx "pau">  XE "pau"   <cx "questions, marking in advance">  XE "questions: marking in advance"   Lojban question words, unlike those of English, frequently do not stand at the beginning of the question. Placing the cmavo “pau” at the beginning of a bridi helps the listener realize that the bridi is a question, like the symbol at the beginning of written Spanish questions that looks like an upside-down question mark. The listener is then warned to watch for the actual question word.
<p>
<cx "pau, placement in sentence">  XE "pau: placement in sentence"   <cx "rhetorical question">  XE "rhetorical question"   <cx "question, rhetorical">  XE “questions: rhetorical"   <lx "paunai">  XE "paunai"   Although “pau” is grammatical in any location (like all indicators), it is not really useful except at or near the beginning of a bridi. Its scalar opposite, “paunai”, signals that a bridi is not really a question despite its form. This is what we call in English a rhetorical question: an example appears in the English text near the beginning of <a href=#s11>Section 11</a>.
<p>
<lx "pe'a">  XE "pe'a"   <cx "figurative speech">  XE "figurative speech"   <ex "blue, as sad">  XE "blue: as sad, example“  The cmavo “pe'a” is the indicator of figurative speech, indicating that the previous word should be taken figuratively rather than literally:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d2>13.2)	mi viska le blanu pe'a zdani
	I see the blue [figurative] house.
	I see the “blue” house.
</pre><p>Here the house is not blue in the sense of color, but in some other sense, whose meaning is entirely culturally dependent. The use of “pe'a” unambiguously marks a cultural reference: “blanu” in <a href=#e13d2>Example 13.2 </a>could mean “sad” (as in English) or something completely different.
<p>
<lx "pe'anai">  XE "pe'anai"   <cx "literally">  XE "literally"   The negated form, “pe'anai”, indicates that what has been said is to be interpreted literally, in the usual way for Lojban; natural-language intuition is to be ignored.
<p>
<cx "lujvo, place structure of figurative lujvo">  XE "lujvo: place structure of figurative lujvo"   <cx "figurative lujvo">  XE "figurative lujvo"   <cx "figurative lujvo, place structure">  XE "figurative lujvo: place structure"   <cx "culturally dependent lujvo">  XE "culturally dependent lujvo"   <ex "heartburn">  XE "heartburn: example“  Alone among the cmavo of selma'o UI, “pe'a” has a rafsi, namely “pev”. This rafsi is used in forming figurative (culturally dependent) lujvo, whose place structure need have nothing to do with the place structure of the components. Thus “risnyjelca” (heart burn) might have a place structure like:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>x1 is the heart of x2, burning in atmosphere x3 at temperature x4
</dl>whereas “pevrisnyjelca”, explicitly marked as figurative, might have the place structure:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>x1 is indigestion/heartburn suffered by x2
</dl>which obviously has nothing to do with the places of either “risna” or “jelca”.
<p>
<lx "bi'u">  XE "bi'u"   <lx "bi'unai">  XE "bi'unai"   <ex "the">  XE "the: example“  <ex "a">  XE "a: example“  <ex "an">  XE "an: example“  <cx "the, contrasted with a/an">  XE "the: contrasted with a/an"   <cx "a/an, contrasted with the">  XE "a/an: contrasted with the"   The uses of “bi'u” and “bi'unai” correspond to one of the uses of the English articles “the” and “a/an”. An English-speaker telling a story may begin with “I saw a man who <dots>…</dots>”. Later in the story, the same man will be referred to with the phrase “the man”. Lojban does not use its articles in the same way: both “a man” and “the man” would be translated “le nanmu”, since the speaker has in mind a specific man. However, the first use might be marked “le bi'u nanmu”, to indicate that this is a new man, not mentioned before. Later uses could correspondingly be tagged “le bi'unai nanmu”.
<p>
Most of the time, the distinction between “bi'u” and “bi'unai” need not be made, as the listener can infer the right referent. However, if a different man were referred to still later in the story, “le bi'u nanmu” would clearly show that this man was different from the previous one.
<p>
<lx "ge'e">  XE "ge'e"   <cx "attitude, avoidance of expression">  XE "attitude: avoidance of expression"   Finally, the indicator “ge'e” has been discussed in <a href=#s8>Sections 8 </a>and <a href=#s10>10</a>. It is used to express an attitude which is not covered by the existing set, or to avoid expressing any attitude.
<p>
Another use for “ge'e” is to explicitly avoid expressing one's feeling on a given scale; in this use, it functions like a member of selma'o CAI: “.iige'e” means roughly “I'm not telling whether I'm afraid or not.”
<p>
<lx "kau">  XE "kau"   <cx "indirect question">  XE "indirect question"   <pre>	kau		indirect question
</pre><p>This cmavo is explained in detail in <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11</a>. It marks the word it is attached to as the focus of an indirect question:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d3>13.3)	mi djuno le du'u dakau klama le zarci
	I know the statement-that somebody [indirect ?] goes to-the store.
	I know who goes to the store.
</pre><a name=s14><h3>Vocative scales</h3>
<p>
<cx "vocatives, definition">  XE "vocatives: definition"   <cx "vocatives, contrasted with “la”">  XE "vocatives: contrasted with \“la\”"   <cx "“la”, contrasted with vocatives">  XE "la: contrasted with vocatives"   <lx "COI">  XE "COI selma’o"   <cx "direct address">  XE "direct address"   ““Vocatives” are words used to address someone directly; they precede and mark a name used in direct address, just as “la” (and the other members of selma'o LA) mark a name used to refer to someone. The vocatives actually are indicators — in fact, discursives — but the need to tie them to names and other descriptions of listeners requires them to be separated from selma'o UI. But like the cmavo of UI, the members of selma'o COI can be “negated” with “nai” to get the opposite part of the scale.
<p>
<cx "redundancy, effect on vocative design">  XE "redundancy: effect on vocative design"   <cx "vocatives, rationale for redundancy">  XE "vocatives: rationale for redundancy"   Because of the need for redundancy in noisy environments, the Lojban design does not compress the vocatives into a minimum number of scales. Doing so would make a non-redundant “nai” too often vital to interpretation of a protocol signal, as explained later in this section.
<p>
<lx "DOhU">  XE "DOhU selma’o"   <lx "do'u">  XE "do'u"   <cx "vocatives, grammar overview">  XE "vocatives: grammar overview"   The grammar of vocatives is explained in <a href=chap6.html>Chapter 6</a>; but in brief, a vocative may be followed by a name (without “la”), a description (without “le” or its relatives), a complete sumti, or nothing at all (if the addressee is obvious from the context). There is an elidable terminator, “do'u” (of selma'o DOhU) which is almost never required unless no name (or other indication of the addressee) follows the vocative.
<p>
<cx "you, defining">  XE "you: defining"   <cx "vocatives, and definition of “you”">  XE "vocatives: and definition of \“you\”"   Using any vocative except “mi'e” (explained below) implicitly defines the meaning of the pro-sumti “do”, as the whole point of vocatives is to specify the listener, or at any rate the desired listener — even if the desired listener isn't listening! We will use the terms “speaker” and “listener” for clarity, although in written Lojban the appropriate terms would be “writer” and “reader”.
<p>
<cx "vocatives, notation convention symbol “X”">  XE "vocatives: notation convention symbol \“X\”"   In the following list of vocatives, the translations include the symbol X. This represents the name (or identifying description, or whatever) of the listener.
<p>
<lx "doi">  XE "doi"   <lx "DOI">  XE "DOI selma’o"   <cx "pause before name, effect of doi">  XE "pause before name: effect of doi"   <cx "doi, effect on pause before name">  XE "doi: effect on pause before name"   The cmavo “doi” is the general-purpose vocative. Unlike the cmavo of selma'o COI, explained below, “doi” can precede a name directly without an intervening pause. It is not considered a scale, and “doinai” is not grammatical. In general, “doi” needs no translation in English (we just use names by themselves without any preceding word, although in poetic styles we sometimes say “Oh X”, which is equivalent to “doi”). One may attach an attitudinal to “doi” to express various English vocatives. For example, “doi .io” means “Sir/Madam!”, whereas “doi .ionai” means “You there!”.
<p>
<cx "pause before name, effect of vocatives of COI">  XE "pause before name: effect of vocatives of COI"   <cx "COI, effect on pause before name">  XE "COI selma’o: effect on pause before name"   All members of selma'o COI require a pause when used immediately before a name, in order to prevent the name from absorbing the COI word. This is unlike selma'o DOI and LA, which do not require pauses because the syllables of these cmavo are not permitted to be embedded in a Lojban name. When calling out to someone, this is fairly natural, anyway. “Hey! John!” is thus a better translation of “ju'i .djan.” than “Hey John!”. No pause is needed if the vocative reference is something other than a name, as in the title of the Lojban journal, “ju'i lobypli”.
<p>
(Alternatively, “doi” can be inserted between the COI cmavo and the name, making a pause unnecessary: “coi doi djan.”)
<p>
<lx "coi">  XE "coi"   <pre>coi		greetings
</pre>“Hello, X”; “Greetings, X”; indicates a greeting to the listener.
<p>
<lx "co'o">  XE "co'o"   <pre>co'o		partings
</pre>“Good-bye, X”; indicates parting from immediate company by either the speaker or the listener. “coico'o” means “greeting in passing”.
<p>
<lx "ju'i">  XE "ju'i"   <pre>ju'i	[jundi]	attention	at ease	ignore me/us
</pre>“Attention/Lo/Hark/Behold/Hey!/Listen, X”; indicates an important communication that the listener should listen to.
<p>
<lx "nu'e">  XE "nu'e"   <pre>nu'e	[nupre]	promise	release promise		non-promise
</pre>“I promise, X”; indicates a promise to the listener. In some contexts, “nu'e” may be prefixed to an oath or other formal declaration.
<p>
<lx "ta'e">  XE "ta'e"   <pre>ta'a	[tavla]	interruption
</pre>“I interrupt, X”, “I desire the floor, X”; a vocative expression to (possibly) interrupt and claim the floor to make a statement or expression. This can be used for both rude and polite interruptions, although rude interruptions will probably tend not to use a vocative at all. An appropriate response to an interruption might be “re'i” (or “re'inai” to ignore the interruption).
<p>
<lx "pe'u">  XE "pe'u"   <pre>pe'u	[cpedu]	request
</pre><cx "pe'u, contrasted with e'o">  XE "pe'u: contrasted with e'o"   <cx "e'o, contrasted with pe'u">  XE "e'o: contrasted with pe'u"   ““Please, X”; indicates a request to the listener. It is a formal, non-attitudinal, equivalent of “.e'o” with a specific recipient being addressed. On the other hand, “.e'o” may be used when there is no specific listener, but merely a “sense of petition floating in the air”, as it were.
<p>
<lx "ki'e">  XE "ki'e"   <pre>ki'e	[ckire]	appreciation		disappreciation
		gratitude		ingratitude
</pre><ex "thank you">  XE "thank you: example“  <cx "politeness, thank you and you're welcome">  XE "politeness: thank you and you're welcome"   <cx "politeness, you're welcome">  XE "politeness: you're welcome"   <lx "je'e">  XE "je'e"   <lx "fi'i">  XE "fi'i"   ““Thank you, X”; indicates appreciation or gratitude toward the listener. The usual response is “je'e”, but “fi'i” is appropriate on rare occasions: see the explanation of “fi'i”.
<p>
<pre>fi'i	[friti]	welcome,		unwelcome,
		offering		inhospitality
</pre><lx "fi'i">  XE "fi'i"   <cx "you're welcome, fi'i contrasted with je'e">  XE "you're welcome: fi'i contrasted with je'e"   <cx "you're welcome, je'e contrasted with fi'i">  XE "you're welcome: je'e contrasted with fi'i"   <ex "hospitality">  XE "hospitality: example“  ““At your service, X”; “Make yourself at home, X”; offers hospitality (possibly in response to thanks, but not necessarily) to the listener. Note that “fi'i” is not the equivalent of American English “You're welcome” as a mechanical response to “Thank you”; that is “je'e”, as noted below.
<p>
<pre>be'e	[benji]	request to send
</pre><lx "be'e">  XE "be'e"   <cx "telephone conversation, hello">  XE "telephone conversation: hello"   ““Request to send to X”; indicates that the speaker wishes to express something, and wishes to ensure that the listener is listening. In a telephone conversation, can be used to request the desired conversant(s). A more colloquial equivalent is “Hello? Can I speak to X?”.
<p>
<pre>re'i	[bredi]	ready to receive		not ready
</pre><lx "re'i">  XE "re'i"   ““Ready to receive, X”; indicates that the speaker is attentive and awaiting communication from the listener. It can be used instead of “mi'e” to respond when called to the telephone. The negative form can be used to prevent the listener from continuing to talk when the speaker is unable to pay attention: it can be translated “Hold on!” or “Just a minute”.
<p>
<pre>mu'o	[mulno]	completion of utterance	more to follow
</pre><lx "mu'o">  XE "mu'o"   ““Over, X”; indicates that the speaker has completed the current utterance and is ready to hear a response from the listener. The negative form signals that the pause or non-linguistic sound which follows does not represent the end of the current utterance: more colloquially, “I'm not done talking!”
<p>
<pre>je'e	[jimpe]	successful receipt		unsuccessful receipt
</pre><lx "je'e">  XE "je'e"   <ex "roger">  XE "roger: example“  <cx "politeness, you're welcome">  XE "politeness: you're welcome"   ““Roger, X!”, “I understand”; acknowledges the successful receipt of a communication from the listener. The negative form indicates failure to receive correctly, and is usually followed by “ke'o”. The colloquial English equivalents of “je'e” and “je'enai” are the grunt typically written “uh-huh” and “What?/Excuse me?”: “je'e” is also used to mean “You're welcome” when that is a response to “Thank you”.
<p>
<pre>vi'o		will comply		will not comply
</pre><lx "vi'o">  XE "vi'o"   <cx "je'e, contrasted with vi'o">  XE "je'e: contrasted with vi'o"   <cx "vi'o, contrasted with je'e">  XE "vi'o: contrasted with je'e"   ““Wilco, X”, “I understand and will comply”. Similar to “je'e” but signals an intention (similar to “.ai”) to comply with the other speaker's request. This cmavo is the main way of saying “OK” in Lojban, in the usual sense of “Agreed!”, although “.ie” carries some of the same meaning. The negative form indicates that the message was received but that you will not comply: a very colloquial version is “No way!”.
<p>
<pre>ke'o	[krefu]	please repeat		no repeat needed
</pre><lx "ke'o">  XE "ke'o"   <cx "ke'o, compared to ki'a">  XE "ke'o: compared to ki'a"   <cx "ki'a, compared to ke’o">  XE "ki'a: compared to ke’o"   ““What did you say, X?”; a request for repetition or clarification due to unsuccessful receipt or understanding. This is the vocative equivalent of “ki'a”, and is related to “je'enai”. The negative form may be rendered “Okay, already; I get the point!”
<p>
<pre>fe'o	[fanmo]	end of communication	not done
</pre><lx "fe'o">  XE "fe'o"   ““Over and out, X”; indicates completion of statement(s) and communication directed at the identified person(s). Used to terminate a letter if a signature is not required because the sender has already been identified (as in memos). The negative form means “Wait, hold it, we're not done!” and differs from “mu'onai” in that it means more exchanges are to follow, rather than that the current exchange is incomplete.
<p>
<cx "fe'o, contrasted with fa'o">  XE "fe'o: contrasted with fa'o"   <cx "fa'o, contrasted with fe'o">  XE "fa'o: contrasted with fe'o"   Do not confuse “fe'o” with “fa'o” (selma'o FAhO) which is a mechanical, extra-grammatical signal that a text is complete. One may say “fe'o” to one participant of a multi-way conversation and then go on speaking to the others.
<p>
<lx "mi'e">  XE "mi'e"   <pre>mi'e	[cmavo: mi]	self-identification	non-identification
</pre><cx "introduce oneself">  XE "introduce oneself"   <cx "mi'e, contrasted with other members of COI">  XE "mi'e: contrasted with other members of COI"   <cx "me, explicitly specifying">  XE "me: explicitly specifying"   ““And I am X”; a generalized self-vocative. Although grammatically just like the other members of selma'o COI, “mi'e” is quite different semantically. In particular, rather than specifying the listener, the person whose name (or description) follows “mi'e” is taken to be the speaker. Therefore, using “mi'e” specifies the meaning of the pro-sumti “mi”. It can be used to introduce oneself, to close letters, or to identify oneself on the telephone.
<p>
<cx "closings, letter">  XE "closings: letter"   <lx "fe’omi'e">  XE "fe’omi'e"   <lx "re'imi'e">  XE "re'imi'e"   <cx "COI, ordering multiple with mi'e">  XE "COI selma’o: ordering multiple with mi'e"   <cx "mi'e, effect of ordering multiple COI">  XE "mi'e: effect of ordering multiple COI"   This cmavo is often combined with other members of COI: “fe'omi'e” would be an appropriate closing at the end of a letter; “re'imi'e” would be a self-vocative used in delayed responses, as when called to the phone, or possibly in a roll-call. As long as the “mi'e” comes last, the following name is that of the speaker; if another COI cmavo is last, the following name is that of the listener. It is not possible to name both speaker and listener in a single vocative expression, but this fact is of no importance, because wherever one vocative expression is grammatical, any number of consecutive ones may appear.
<p>

This form of translation does not mean that Lojban is a language of CB enthusiasts, but rather that in most natural languages these forms are so well handled by the context that only in specific domains (like speaking on the radio) do they need special words. In Lojban, dependence on the context can be dangerous, as speaker and listener may not share the right context, and so the vocatives provide a formal protocol for use when it is appropriate. Other appropriate contexts include computer communications and parliamentary procedure: in the latter context, the protocol question “ta'apei” would mean “Will the speaker yield?”

<p>
<cx "Kzinti, communication with">  XE "Kzinti: communication with"   <cx "aliens, communication with">  XE "aliens: communication with"   <cx "indicators, ramifications">  XE "indicators: ramifications"   The exact ramifications of the indicator system in actual usage are unknown. There has never been anything like it in natural language before. The system provides great potential for emotional expression and transcription, from which significant Sapir-Whorf effects can be anticipated. When communicating across cultural boundaries, where different indicators are often used for the same emotion, accidental offense can be avoided. If we ever ran into an alien race, a culturally neutral language of emotion could be vital. (A classic example, taken from the science fiction of Larry Niven, is to imagine speaking Lojban to the carnivorous warriors called Kzinti, noting that a human smile bares the teeth, and could be seen as an intent to attack.) And for communicating emotions to computers, when we cannot identify all of the signals involved in subliminal human communication (things like body language are also cultural), a system like this is needed.
<p>
<cx "indicators, rationale for selection">  XE "indicators: rationale for selection"   We have tried to err on the side of overkill. There are distinctions possible in this system that no one may care to make in any culture. But it was deemed more neutral to overspecify and let usage decide, than to choose a limited set and constrain emotional expression. For circumstances in which even the current indicator set is not enough, it is possible using the cmavo “sei”, explained in <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19</a>, to create metalinguistic comments that act like indicators.
<p>
<cx "indicators, evolutionary development of">  XE "indicators: evolutionary development of"   We envision an evolutionary development. At this point, the system is little more than a mental toy. Many of you who read this will try playing around with various combinations of indicators, trying to figure out what emotions they express and when the expressions might be useful. You may even find an expression for which there currently is no good English word and start using it. Why not, if it helps you express your feelings?
<p>
There will be a couple dozen of these used pretty much universally – mostly just simple attitudinals with, at most, intensity markers. These are the ones that will quickly be expressed at the subconscious level. But every Lojbanist who plays with the list will bring in a couple of new words. Poets will paint emotional pictures, and people who identify with those pictures will use the words so created for their own experiences.
<p>
Just as a library of tanru is built up, so will a library of attitudes be built. Unlike the tanru, though, the emotional expressions are built on some fairly nebulous root emotions — words that cannot be defined with the precision of the gismu. The emotion words of Lojban will very quickly take on a life of their own, and the outline given here will evolve into a true system of emotions.
<p>
<cx "emotions, recording using indicators">  XE "emotions: recording using indicators"   <cx "emotions, research using indicators">  XE "emotions: research using indicators"   There are several theories as to the nature of emotion, and they change from year to year as we learn more about ourselves. Whether or not Lojban's additive/scalar emotional model is an accurate model for human emotions, it does support the linguistic needs for expressing those emotions. Researchers may learn more about the nature of human emotions by exploring the use of the system by Lojban speakers. They also may be able to use the Lojban system as a means for more clearly recording emotions.
<p>
<cx "emotions, cultural bias of expression">  XE "emotions: cultural bias of expression"   The full list of scales and attitudes will probably not be used until someone speaks the language from birth. Until then, people will use the attitudes that are important to them. In this way, we counter cultural bias — if a culture is prone to recognizing and/or expressing certain emotions more than others, its members will use only those out of the enormous set available. If a culture hides certain emotions, its members simply won't express them.
<p>
<cx "Sapir-Whorf effects, and emotional indicators">  XE "Sapir-Whorf effects: and emotional indicators"   Perhaps native Lojban speakers will be more expressively clear about their emotions than others. Perhaps they will feel some emotions more strongly than others in ways that can be correlated with the word choices; any difference from the norms of other cultures could be significant. Psychologists have devised elaborate tests for measuring attitudes and personality; this may be the easiest area in which to detect any systematic cultural effect of the type sought to confirm Sapir-Whorf, simply because we already have tools in existence to test it. Because Lojban is unique among languages in having such extensive and expressive indicators, it is likely that a Sapir-Whorf effect will occur and will be recognized.
<p>
It is unlikely that we will know the true potential of a system like this one until and unless we have children raised entirely in a multi-cultural Lojban-speaking environment. We learn too many cultural habits in the realm of emotional communication “at our mother's knee”. Such children will have a Lojban system that has stronger reinforcement than any typical culture system. The second generation of such children, then, could be said to be the start of a true Lojbanic culture.
<p>
<cx "emotional indicators, noticeable effects of">  XE "emotional indicators: noticeable effects of"   We shouldn't need to wait that long to detect significant effects. Emotion is so basic to our lives that even a small change or improvement in emotional communication would have immediately noticeable effects. Perhaps it will be the case that the most important contribution of our “logical language” will be in the non-logical realm of emotion!

If Wishes Were Horses: The Lojban Connective System</h2>

<p>
<a name=s1><h3>Logical connection and truth tables</h3>
<p>
<cx "logical language, truth functions">  XE "logical language: truth functions"   <cx "truth functions">  XE "truth functions"   Lojban is a logical language: the name of the language itself means “logical language”. The fundamentals of ordinary logic (there are variant logics, which aren't addressed in this book) include the notions of a “sentence” (sometimes called a “statement” or “proposition”), which asserts a truth or falsehood, and a small set of “truth functions”, which combine two sentences to create a new sentence. The truth functions have the special characteristic that the truth value (that is, the truth or falsehood) of the results depends only on the truth value of the component sentences. For example,
<p>
<ex "man or woman">  XE "man or woman: example“  <pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	John is a man or James is a woman.
</pre>is true if “John is a man” is true, or if “James is a woman” is true. If we know whether John is a man, and we know whether James is a woman, we know whether “John is a man or James is a woman” is true, provided we know the meaning of “or”. Here “John is a man” and “James is a woman” are the component sentences.
<p>
<cx "negating a sentence, and truth value">  XE "negating a sentence: and truth value"   We will use the phrase “negating a sentence” to mean changing its truth value. An English sentence may always be negated by prefixing “It is false that <dots>…</dots>”, or more idiomatically by inserting “not” at the right point, generally before the verb. “James is not a woman” is the negation of “James is a woman”, and vice versa. Recent slang can also negate a sentence by following it with the exclamation “Not!”
<p>
<cx "logical connectives">  XE "logical connectives"   Words like “or” are called “logical connectives”, and Lojban has many of them, as befits a logical language. This chapter is mostly concerned with explaining the forms and uses of the Lojban logical connectives. There are a number of other logical connectives in English such as “and”, “and/or”, “if”, “only if”, “whether or not”, and others; however, not every use of these English words corresponds to a logical connective. This point will be made clear in particular cases as needed. The other English meanings are supported by different Lojban connective constructs.
<p>
The Lojban connectives form a system (as the title of this chapter suggests), regular and predictable, whereas natural-language connectives are rather less systematic and therefore less predictable.
<p>
<cx "truth functions, 16 possible">  XE "truth functions: 16 possible"   <cx "truth table, explanation">  XE "truth table: explanation"   There exist 16 possible different truth functions. A truth table is a graphical device for specifying a truth function, making it clear what the value of the truth function is for every possible value of the component sentences. Here is a truth table for “or”:
<p>
<pre> 	first	second	result
	True	True	True
	True	False	True
	False	True	True
	False	False	False
</pre><p>This table means that if the first sentence stated is true, and the second sentence stated is true, then the result of the truth function is also true. The same is true for every other possible combination of truth values except the one where both the first and the second sentences are false, in which case the truth value of the result is also false.
<p>
Suppose that “John is a man” is true (and “John is not a man” is false), and that “James is a woman” is false (and “James is not a woman” is true). Then the truth table tells us that
<p>
<dl compact><dt>	<dd>“John is a man, or James is not a woman” 	(true, true) is true;
	“John is a man, or James is a woman”		(true, false) is true;
	“John is not a man, or James is not a woman”	(false, true) is true;
	“John is not a man, or James is a woman”		(false, false) is false.
</dl><cx "or”, “and/or” contrasted with “either … or … but not both">  XE "or\”: \“and/or\” contrasted with \“either … or … but not both"   Note that the kind of “or” used in this example can also be expressed (in formal English) with “and/or”. There is a different truth table for the kind of “or” that means “either <dots>…</dots> or <dots>…</dots> but not both”.
<p>
<cx "truth tables, abbreviated format">  XE "truth tables: abbreviated format"   <cx "truth tables, notation convention">  XE "truth tables: notation convention"   To save space, we will write truth tables in a shorter format henceforth. Let the letters T and F stand for True and False. The rows will always be given in the order shown above: TT, TF, FT, FF for the two sentences. Then it is only necessary to give the four letters from the result column, which can be written TTTF, as can be seen by reading down the third column of the table above. So TTTF is the abbreviated truth table for the “or” truth function. Here are the 16 possible truth functions, with an English version of what it means to assert that each function is, in fact, true (“first” refers to the first sentence, and “second” to the second sentence):
<p>
<cx "truth tables, list of 16 in abbreviated form">  XE "truth tables: list of 16 in abbreviated form"   <pre> 	TTTT	(always true)
	TTTF	first is true and/or second is true.
	TTFT	first is true if second is true.
	TTFF	first is true whether or not second is true.
	TFTT	first is true only if second is true.
	TFTF	whether or not first is true, second is true.
	TFFT	first is true if and only if second is true.
	TFFF	first is true and second is true
	FTTT	first and second are not both true.
	FTTF	first or second is true, but not both.
	FTFT	whether or not first is true, second is false.
	FTFF	first is true, but second is false.
	FFTT	first is false whether or not second is true.
	FFTF	first is false, but second is true.
	FFFT	neither first nor second is true.
	FFFF	(always false)
</pre><p>Skeptics may work out the detailed truth tables for themselves.
<p>
<a name=s2><h3>The four basic vowels</h3>
<p>
<cx "truth functions, fundamental 4 in Lojban">  XE "truth functions: fundamental 4 in Lojban"   <cx "truth functions, relation to logical connectives">  XE "truth functions: relation to logical connectives"   <cx "logical connectives, relation to truth functions">  XE "logical connectives: relation to truth functions"   Lojban regards four of these 16 truth functions as fundamental, and assigns them the four letters vowels <font face="Brush Script MT, Script">A</font>, <font face="Brush Script MT, Script">E</font>, <font face="Brush Script MT, Script">O</font>, and <font face="Brush Script MT, Script">U</font>. These letters do not represent actual cmavo or selma'o, but rather a component vowel from which actual logical-connective cmavo are built up, as explained in the next section. Here are the four vowels, their truth tables, and rough English equivalents:

<p>
<cx "truth tables, for 4 fundamental Lojban truth functions">  XE "truth tables: for 4 fundamental Lojban truth functions"   <cx "fancy A, notation convention">  XE "fancy A: notation convention"   <cx "fancy E, notation convention">  XE "fancy E: notation convention"   <cx "fancy O, notation convention">  XE "fancy O: notation convention"   <cx "fancy U, notation convention">  XE "fancy U: notation convention"   <pre>	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">A</font> 	TTTF	or, and/or
	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">E</font> 	TFFF	and
	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">O</font> 	TFFT	if and only if
	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">U</font> 	TTFF	whether or not
</pre><p>More precisely:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd><font face="Brush Script MT, Script">	A  </font>is true if either or both sentences are true;
	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">E  </font>is true if both sentences are true, but not otherwise;
	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">O  </font>is true if the sentences are both true or both false;
	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">U  </font>is true if the first sentence is true, regardless of the truth value of the 
		second sentence.
</dl><cx "truth functions, creating all 16 with Lojban's basic set">  XE "truth functions: creating all 16 with Lojban's basic set"   With the four vowels, the ability to negate either sentence, and the ability to exchange the sentences, as if their order had been reversed, we can create all of the 16 possible truth functions except TTTT and FFFF, which are fairly useless anyway. The following table illustrates how to create each of the 14 remaining truth functions:
<p>
<pre> 	TTTF	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">A</font>
	TTFT	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">A  </font>with second sentence negated
	TTFF	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">U</font>
	TFTT	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">A  </font>with first sentence negated
	TFTF	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">U  </font>with sentences exchanged
	TFFT	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">O</font>
	TFFF	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">E</font>
	FTTT	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">A  </font>with both sentences negated
	FTTF	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">O  </font>with either first or second negated (not both)
	FTFT	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">U  </font>with sentences exchanged and then second negated
	FTFF	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">E  </font>with second sentence negated
	FFTT	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">U  </font>with first sentence negated
	FFTF	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">E  </font>with first sentence negated
	FFFT	<font face="Brush Script MT, Script">E  </font>with both sentences negated
</pre><cx "commutative truth functions">  XE "commutative truth functions"   <cx "truth functions, commutative">  XE "truth functions: commutative"   Note that exchanging the sentences is only necessary with <font face="Brush Script MT, Script">U</font>. The three other basic truth functions are commutative; that is, they mean the same thing regardless of the order of the component sentences. There are other ways of getting some of these truth tables; these just happen to be the methods usually employed.
<p>
<a name=s3><h3>The six types of logical connectives</h3>
<p>
<cx "logical connectives, rationale for multiple sets in grammar">  XE "logical connectives: rationale for multiple sets in grammar"   In order to remain unambiguous, Lojban cannot have only a single logical connective for each truth function. There are many places in the grammar of the language where logical connection is permitted, and each must have its appropriate set of connectives. If the connective suitable for sumti were used to connect selbri, ambiguity would result. 

Consider the English sentence:
<p>
<ex "window">  XE "window: example“  <pre><a name=e3d1>3.1)	Mary went to the window and <dots>…</dots>
</pre>where the last word could be followed by “the door”, a noun phrase, or by “saw the horses”, a sentence with subject omitted, or by “John went to the door”, a full sentence, or by one of a variety of other English grammatical constructions. Lojban cannot tolerate such grammatical looseness.
<p>
<lx "A">  XE “A selma’o"   <lx "GA">  XE "GA selma’o"   <lx "GIhA">  XE "GIhA selma’o"   <lx "JA">  XE "JA selma’o"   <cx "logical connective selma'o, enumerated">  XE “logical connectives: selma'o, enumerated"   Instead, there are a total of five different selma'o used for logical connection: A, GA, GIhA, GUhA, and JA. Each of these includes four cmavo, one based on each of the four vowels, which is always the last vowel in the cmavo. In selma'o A, the vowel is the entire cmavo.
<p>
<cx "logical connective cmavo, format for each selma'o">  XE “logical connectives: cmavo, format for each selma'o"   Thus, in selma'o A, the cmavo for the function <font face="Brush Script MT, Script">A </font>is “a”. (Do not confuse A, which is a selma'o, with <font face="Brush Script MT, Script">A</font>, which is a truth function, or “a”, which is a cmavo.) Likewise, the cmavo for <font face="Brush Script MT, Script">E </font>in selma'o GIhA is “gi'e”, and the cmavo for <font face="Brush Script MT, Script">U </font>in selma'o GA is “gu”. This systematic regularity makes the cmavo easier to learn.
<p>
<cx "compound logical connectives, components">  XE "compound logical connectives: components"   Obviously, four cmavo are not enough to express the 14 truth functions explained in <a href=#s1>Section 1</a>. Therefore, compound cmavo must be used. These compound cmavo follow a systematic pattern: each has one cmavo from the five logical connection selma'o at its heart, and may also contain one or more of the auxiliary cmavo “se”, “na”, or “nai”. Which auxiliaries are used with which logical connection cmavo, and with what grammar and meaning, will be explained in the following sections. The uses of each of these auxiliary cmavo relates to its other uses in other parts of Lojban grammar.
<p>
<cx "compound logical connectives, naming convention">  XE "compound logical connectives: naming convention"   <cx "-ek, in name for logical connectives">  XE "-ek: in name for logical connectives"   <cx "ek, definition">  XE "ek: definition"   <cx "jek, definition">  XE "jek: definition"   <lx "A">  XE “A selma’o"   <lx "JA">  XE "JA selma’o"   For convenience, each of the types of compound cmavo used for logical connection is designated by a Lojban name. The name is derived by changing the final “-A” of the selma'o name to “-ek”; the reasons for using “-ek” are buried deep in the history of the Loglan Project. Thus, compound cmavo based on selma'o A are known as eks, and those based on selma'o JA are known as jeks. (When writing in English, it is conventional to use “eks” as the plural of “ek”.) When the term “logical connective” is used in this chapter, it refers to one or more of these kinds of compound cmavo.

A jek may be preceded by “.i”, the usual Lojban cmavo for connecting two sentences. The compound produced by “.i” followed by a jek is known as an ijek. It is useful to think of ijeks as a sixth kind of logical connective, parallel to eks, jeks, geks, giheks, and guheks.

The kind of logical connective which is placed between two Lojban bridi to connect them logically is an ijek:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d1>4.1)	la djan. nanmu  .ija la djeimyz. ninmu
	John is-a-man or James is-a-woman.
</pre><p>Here we have two separate Lojban bridi, “la djan. nanmu” and “la djeimyz. ninmu”. These bridi are connected by “.ija”, the ijek for the truth function <font face="Brush Script MT, Script">A</font>. The “.i” portion of the ijek tells us that we are dealing with separate sentences here. Similarly, we can now say:

<p>
<pre><a name=e4d2>4.2)	la djan. nanmu  .ije la djeimyz. ninmu
	John is-a-man and James is-a-woman.
<a name=e4d3>4.3)	la djan. nanmu  .ijo la djeimyz. ninmu
	John is-a-man if-and-only-if James is-a-woman.
<a name=e4d4>4.4)	la djan. nanmu  .iju la djeimyz. ninmu
	John is-a-man whether-or-not James is-a-woman.
</pre><cx "bridi, logical connection with negation">  XE "bridi: logical connection with negation"   To obtain the other truth tables listed in <a href=#s2>Section 2</a>, we need to know how to negate the two bridi which represent the component sentences. We could negate them directly by inserting “na” before the selbri, but Lojban also allows us to place the negation within the connective itself.
<p>
<lx "JA">  XE "JA selma’o"   <lx "I">  XE "I selma’o"   To negate the first or left-hand bridi, prefix “na” to the JA cmavo but after the “.i”. To negate the second or right-hand bridi, suffix “-nai” to the JA cmavo. In either case, the negating word is placed on the side of the connective that is closest to the bridi being negated.
<p>
So to express the truth table FTTF, which requires <font face="Brush Script MT, Script">O </font>with either of the two bridi negated (not both), we can say either:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d5>4.5)	la djan. nanmu  .inajo la djeimyz. ninmu
	John is-not-a-man if-and-only-if James is-a-woman.
<a name=e4d6>4.6)	la djan. nanmu  .ijonai la djeimyz. ninmu
	John is a man if-and-only-if James is-not-a-woman
</pre><p>The meaning of both <a href=#e4d5>Example 4.5 </a>and <a href=#e4d6>Example 4.6 </a>is the same as that of:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d7>4.7)	John is a man or James is a woman, but not both.
</pre><p>Here is another example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d8>4.8)	la djan. nanmu  .ijanai la djeimyz. ninmu
	John is-a-man or James is-not-a-woman.
	John is a man if James is a woman.
</pre><cx "if, meaning in logical connections">  XE "if: meaning in logical connections"   <cx "if, English usage contrasted with Lojban logical connective">  XE "if: English usage contrasted with Lojban logical connective"   How's that again? Are those two English sentences in <a href=#e4d8>Example 4.8 </a>really equivalent? In English, no. The Lojban TTFT truth function can be glossed “A if B”, but the “if” does not quite have its English sense. <a href=#e4d8>Example 4.8 </a>is true so long as John is a man, even if James is not a woman; likewise, it is true just because James is not a woman, regardless of John's gender. This kind of “if-then” is technically known as a “material conditional”.
<p>
Since James is not a woman (by our assertions in <a href=#s1>Section 1</a>), the English sentence “John is a man if James is a woman” seems to be neither true nor false, since it assumes something which is not true. It turns out to be most convenient to treat this “if” as TTFT, which on investigation means that <a href=#e4d8>Example 4.8 </a>is true. <a href=#e4d9>Example 4.9</a>, however, is equally true:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d9>4.9)	la djan. ninmu  .ijanai la djeimyz. ninmu
	John is a woman if James is a woman.
</pre><cx "principle of consistency, of logical-if statements">  XE "principle of consistency: of logical-if statements"   <cx "false statement, implications of">  XE "false statement: implications of"   This can be thought of as a principle of consistency, and may be paraphrased as follows: “If a false statement is true, any statement follows from it.” All uses of English “if” must be considered very carefully when translating into Lojban to see if they really fit this Lojban mold.
<p>

The last gloss of <a href=#e4d10>Example 4.10 </a>illustrates the use of “if <dots>…</dots> then” as a more natural substitute for “only if”.
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d10>4.10)	la djan. nanmu  .inaja la djeimyz. ninmu

<a name=s5><h3>Forethought bridi connection</h3>
<p>
<cx "afterthought, contrasted with forethought for connectives">  XE "afterthought connective(s): contrasted with forethought connective"   <cx "forethought, contrasted with afterthought for connectives">  XE "forethought connective(s): contrasted with afterthought connective"   Many concepts in Lojban are expressible in two different ways, generally referred to as “afterthought” and “forethought”. <a href=#s4>Section 4 </a>discussed what is called “afterthought bridi logical connection”. The word “afterthought” is used because the connective cmavo and the second bridi were added, as it were, afterwards and without changing the form of the first bridi. This form might be used by someone who makes a statement and then wishes to add or qualify that statement after it has been completed. Thus,
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	la djan. nanmu
</pre>is a complete bridi, and adding an afterthought connection to make
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d2>5.2)	la djan. nanmu  .ija la djeimyz. ninmu
	John is a man or James is a woman (or both)
</pre>provides additional information without requiring any change in the form of what has come before; changes may not be possible or practical, especially in speaking. (The meaning, however, may be changed by the use of a negating connective.) Afterthought connectives make it possible to construct all the important truth-functional relationships in a variety of ways.
<p>
<cx "gek, definition">  XE "gek: definition"   <cx "ijek bridi connectives, contrasted with geks">  XE "ijek bridi connectives: contrasted with geks"   <cx "gek bridi connectives, contrasted with ijeks">  XE "gek bridi connectives: contrasted with ijeks"   <cx "forethought bridi connectives, contrasted with afterthought bridi connectives">  XE "forethought bridi connectives: contrasted with afterthought bridi connectives"   <cx "afterthought bridi connectives, contrasted with forethought bridi connectives">  XE "afterthought bridi connectives: contrasted with forethought bridi connectives"   <lx "GA">  XE "GA selma’o"   <lx "JA">  XE "JA selma’o"   <lx "I">  XE "I selma’o"   In forethought style the speaker decides in advance, before expressing the first bridi, that a logical connection will be expressed. Forethought and afterthought connectives are expressed with separate selma'o. The forethought logical connectives corresponding to afterthought ijeks are geks:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d3>5.3)	ga la djan. nanmu gi la djeimyz. ninmu
	Either John is a man or James is a woman (or both).
</pre><lx "GA">  XE "GA selma’o"   <lx "GI">  XE "GI selma’o"   “ga” is the cmavo which represents the <font face="Brush Script MT, Script">A </font>truth function in selma'o GA. The word “gi” does not belong to GA at all, but constitutes its own selma'o: it serves only to separate the two bridi without having any content of its own. The English translation of “ga <dots>…</dots>gi” is “either <dots>…</dots> or”, but in the English form the truth function is specified both by the word “either” and by the word “or”: not so in Lojban.
<p>
<cx "forethought bridi connection, as grammatically one sentence">  XE "forethought bridi connection: as grammatically one sentence"   <cx "i, regarding forethought bridi connection">  XE "i: regarding forethought bridi connection"   <lx "I">  XE "I selma’o"   Even though two bridi are being connected, geks and giks do not have any “.i” in them. The forethought construct binds up the two bridi into a single sentence as far as the grammar is concerned.
<p>
Some more examples of forethought bridi connection are:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d4>5.4)	ge la djan. nanmu gi la djeimyz. ninmu
	(It is true that) both John is a man and James is a woman.
</pre><lx "gu">  XE "gu"   <lx "GU">  XE "GU selma’o"   <pre><a name=e5d5>5.5)	gu la djan. nanmu gi la djeimyz. ninmu
	It is true that John is a man, whether or not James is a woman.
</pre><p>It is worth emphasizing that <a href=#e5d5>Example 5.5 </a>does not assert that James is (or is not) a woman. The “gu” which indicates that “la djeimyz. ninmu” may be true or false is unfortunately rather remote from the bridi thus affected.
<p>
Perhaps the most important of the truth functions commonly expressed in forethought is TFTT, which can be paraphrased as “if <dots>… </dots>then <dots>…</dots>”:
<p>
<lx "ganai">  XE "ganai"   <lx "GA">  XE "GA selma’o"   <pre><a name=e5d6>5.6)	ganai la djan. nanmu gi la djeimyz. ninmu
	Either John is not a man, or James is a woman.
	If John is a man, then James is a woman.
</pre><cx "nai, placement in forethought bridi connection contrasted with afterthought">  XE "nai: placement in forethought bridi connection contrasted with afterthought"   <cx "nai, placement in afterthought bridi connection contrasted with forethought">  XE "nai: placement in afterthought bridi connection contrasted with forethought"   Note the placement of the “nai” in <a href=#e5d6>Example 5.6</a>. When added to afterthought selma'o such as JA, a following “nai” negates the second bridi, to which it is adjacent. Since GA cmavo precede the first bridi, a following “nai” negates the first bridi instead.
<p>
<cx "logical connectives, negated first sentence as a potential problem for understanding">  XE "logical connectives: negated first sentence as a potential problem for understanding"   Why does English insist on forethought in the translation of <a href=#e5d6>Example 5.6</a>? Possibly because it would be confusing to seemingly assert a sentence and then make it conditional (which, as the Lojban form shows, involves a negation). Truth functions which involve negating the first sentence may be confusing, even to the Lojbanic understanding, when expressed using afterthought.
<p>
<cx "if … then, logical connectives contrasted with other translations">  XE "if … then: logical connectives contrasted with other translations"   It must be reiterated here that not every use of English “if <dots>…</dots> then” is properly translated by “.inaja” or “ganai <dots>…</dots>gi”; anything with implications of time needs a somewhat different Lojban translation, which will be discussed in <a href=#s18>Section 18</a>. Causal sentences like “If you feed the pig, then it will grow” are not logical connectives of any type, but rather need a translation using “rinka” as the selbri joining two event abstractions, thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d7>5.7)	le nu do cidja dunda fi le xarju cu rinka le nu ri ba banro
	The event-of (you food-give to the pig) causes the event-of (it will grow).
</pre><p>Causality is discussed in far more detail in <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>.
<p>
<a href=#e5d8>Example 5.8 </a>and <a href=#e5d9>Example 5.9 </a>illustrates a truth function, FTTF, which needs to negate either the first or the second bridi. We already understand how to negate the first bridi:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d8>5.8)	gonai la djan. nanmu gi la djeimyz. ninmu
	John is-not-a-man if-and-only-if James is-a-woman,
	Either John is a man or James is a woman but not both.

</pre><lx "ginai">  XE "ginai"   <lx "GI">  XE "GI selma’o"   How can the second bridi be negated? By adding “-nai” to the “gi”.
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d9>5.9)	go la djan. nanmu ginai la djeimyz. ninmu
	John is-a-man if-and-only-if James is-not-a-woman.
	Either John is a man or James is a woman but not both.
</pre><cx "gik, definition">  XE "gik: definition"   <lx "GI">  XE "GI selma’o"   A compound cmavo based on “gi” is called a gik; the only giks are “gi” itself and “ginai”.

However, it is often the case that two bridi to be logically connected have one or more portions in common:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d1>6.1)	la djan. klama le zarci  .ije la .alis. klama le zarci
	John goes to the market, and Alice goes to the market.
</pre><p>Here only a single sumti differs between the two bridi. Lojban does not require that both bridi be expressed in full. Instead, a single bridi can be given which contains both of the different sumti and uses a logical connective from a different selma'o to combine the two sumti:
<p>
<lx ".e">  XE "e"   <lx "A">  XE “A selma’o"   <pre><a name=e6d2>6.2)	la djan .e la .alis. klama le zarci
	John and Alice go-to the market.
</pre><cx "logical connection, transformation between forms">  XE "logical connection: transformation between forms"   <a href=#e6d2>Example 6.2 </a>means exactly the same thing as <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1</a>: one may be rigorously transformed into the other without any change of logical meaning. This rule is true in general for every different kind of logical connection in Lojban; all of them, with one exception (see <a href=#s12>Section 12</a>), can always be transformed into a logical connection between sentences that expresses the same truth function.
<p>
<cx "sumti connection, afterthought">  XE "sumti connection: afterthought"   <cx "eks, in sumti forethought logical connection">  XE "eks: in sumti forethought logical connection"   <lx "A">  XE “A selma’o"   The afterthought logical connectives between sumti are eks, which contain a connective cmavo of selma'o A. If ijeks were used in <a href=#e6d2>Example 6.2</a>, the meaning would be changed:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d3>6.3)	la djan.  .ije la .alis. klama le zarci
	John [is/does something].  And Alices goes-to the market.
</pre>leaving the reader uncertain why John is mentioned at all.

<p>
Any ek may be used between sumti, even if there is no direct English equivalent:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d4>6.4)	la djan. .o la .alis. klama le zarci
	John if-and-only-if Alice goes-to the market.
	John goes to the market if, and only if, Alice does.
</pre><p>The second line of <a href=#e6d3>Example 6.3 </a>is highly stilted English, but the first line (of which it is a literal translation) is excellent Lojban.

	John goes to the market only if Alice does.
</pre><p>Note the period in “na.a”. The cmavo of A begin with vowels, and therefore must always be preceded by a pause. It is conventional to write all connective compounds as single words (with no spaces), but this pause must still be marked in writing as in speech; otherwise, the “na” and “a” would tend to run together.
<p>
<a name=s7><h3>More than two propositions</h3>
<p>
<cx "logical connectives, more than 2 sentences">  XE "logical connectives: more than 2 sentences"   So far we have seen logical connectives used to connect exactly two sentences. How about connecting three or more? Is this possible in Lojban? The answer is yes, subject to some warnings and some restrictions.

Therefore,
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	mi dotco  .ije mi ricfu  .ije mi nanmu
	I am-German.  And I am-rich.  And I am-a-man.
</pre>means that all three component sentences are true. Likewise,
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d2>7.2)	mi dotco .ija mi ricfu .ija mi nanmu
	I am-German. Or I am-rich. Or I am-a-man.

Likewise, the connectives which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two sentences.
<p>
<cx "logical connection of more than 2 sentences, all or none">  XE “logical connection: of more than 2 sentences, all or none"   In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the “all or none” interpretation intended (but not achieved) by <a href=#e7d3>Example 7.3 </a>without repeating one of the bridi.

The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives are not subject to this problem:
<p>

<lx "bo">  XE "bo"   <lx "BO">  XE "BO selma’o"   <cx "logical connectives, grouping with bo">  XE "logical connectives: grouping with bo"   <cx "logical connection with bo, precedence">  XE “logical connection: with bo, precedence"   <cx "bo, in logical connectives">  XE "bo: in logical connectives"   There are several ways in Lojban to render <a href=#e7d5>Example 7.5 </a>using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use of the cmavo “bo” (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if “bo” is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with “bo” are interpreted before connections not so marked. <a href=#e8d1>Example 8.1 </a>is equivalent in meaning to <a href=#e7d8>Example 7.8</a>:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d1>8.1)	mi nelci la djan.  .ije mi nelci la martas.  .ijabo mi nelci la meris.
	I like John, and I like Martha or I like Mary.
</pre><p>The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far more clearly: the “I like Martha” and “I like Mary” sentences are joined by “.ija” first, before the result is joined to “I like John” by “.ije”. <dl compact><dt><dd>Eks can have “bo” attached in exactly the same way, so that <a href=#e8d2>Example 8.2 </a>is equivalent in meaning to Example 8.l:
<p><dt><a name=e8d2>8.2)	<dd>mi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.
</dl><cx "forethought connectives and bo">  XE "forethought connectives and bo"   <cx "bo and forethought connectives">  XE "bo and forethought connectives"   Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with “bo”, for every use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.
<p>
What happens if “bo” is used on both connectives, giving them the same high precedence, as in <a href=#e8d3>Example 8.3</a>?
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d3>8.3)	mi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.
</pre><cx "bo, right-grouping">  XE "bo: right-grouping"   <cx "logical connectives, right-grouping with bo">  XE "logical connectives: right-grouping with bo"   <lx "BO">  XE "BO selma’o"   Does this wind up meaning the same as <a href=#e7d4>Example 7.4 </a>and <a href=#e7d6>Example 7.6</a>? Not at all. A second rule relating to “bo” is that where several “bo”-marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, <a href=#e8d3>Example 8.3 </a>in fact means the same as <a href=#e8d{1}>Examples 8.1 </a>and <a href=#e8d2>8.2</a>. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with “bo” should be avoided.
<p>
<cx "complex logical connection, grouping strategies contrasted">  XE "complex logical connection: grouping strategies contrasted"   <cx "logical connection, grouping strategies for complex cases contrasted">  XE "logical connection: grouping strategies for complex cases contrasted"   <lx "tu'e">  XE "tu'e"   <lx "tu'u">  XE "tu'u"   <lx "ke">  XE "ke"   <lx "ke'e">  XE "ke'e"   <lx "TUhE">  XE "TUhE selma’o"   <lx "TUhU">  XE "TUhU selma’o"   <lx "KE">  XE "KE selma’o"   <lx "KEhE">  XE "KEhE selma’o"   <cx "complex logical connectives, grouping with parentheses">  XE "complex logical connectives: grouping with parenthesis"   The use of “bo”, therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than three sentences. Look back at the English translations of <a href=#e7d{7}>Examples 7.7 </a>and <a href=#e7d8>7.8</a>: parentheses were used to clarify the grouping. These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. “tu'e” and “tu'u” are used with ijeks, and “ke” and “ke'e” with eks and other connectives to be discussed later. (“ke” and “ke'e” are also used in other roles in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d4>8.4)	I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.
</pre><cx "complex logical connectives, grouping with bo">  XE "complex logical connectives: grouping with bo"   <lx "BO">  XE "BO selma’o"   <lx "bo">  XE "bo"   where the semantics tells us that the instances of “and” are meant to have higher precedence than that of “if”. If we wish to express <a href=#e8d4>Example 8.4 </a>in afterthought, we can say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d5>8.5)	mi cinba do .ije[bo] do cinba mi  .ijanai mi prami do .ijebo do prami mi
	I kiss you and you kiss me, if I love you and you love me.
</pre>marking two of the ijeks with “bo” for high precedence. (The first “bo” is not strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)
<p>
<cx "complex logical connectives, grouping with parentheses">  XE "complex logical connectives: grouping with parenthesis"   But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d6>8.6)	tu'e mi cinba do .ije do cinba mi tu'u  
		.ijanai tu'e mi prami do  .ije do prami mi [tu'u]
	( I kiss you and you kiss me )
		if ( I love you and you love me).
</pre>where the “tu'e <dots>…</dots>tu'u” pairs set off the structure. The cmavo “tu'u” is an elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in <a href=#e8d6>Example 8.6 </a>is bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of a text.
<p>
In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to “bo” grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.
<p>
Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of “tu'e <dots>…</dots>tu'u” parentheses may actually be left off altogether, producing:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d7>8.7)	mi cinba do .ije do cinba mi
		.ijanai tu'e mi prami do  .ije do prami mi [tu'u]
	I kiss you and you kiss me
		if ( I love you and you love me ).

</pre><p>What about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d8>8.8)	I walk to either the market and the house, or the school and the office.
</pre><cx "logical connection of sumti, grouping with parentheses">  XE “logical connection: of sumti, grouping with parenthesis"   <cx "logical connection of sumti, restriction on ke">  XE “logical connection: of sumti, restriction on ke"   <cx "sumti, beginning with "ke">  XE "sumti: beginning with \"ke"   <lx "ke">  XE "ke"   <lx "KE">  XE "KE selma’o"   Two pairs of parentheses, analogous to <a href=#e8d6>Example 8.6</a>, would seem to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not begin with “ke”, so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing <a href=#e8d10>Example 8.10</a>, which is instead parallel to <a href=#e8d7>Example 8.7</a>:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d9>8.9)	mi dzukla le zarci .e le zdani .a ke le ckule .e le briju [ke'e]

</pre><cx "ke in sumti grouping, where allowed">  XE "ke in sumti grouping: where allowed"   <lx "ke">  XE "ke"   <lx "KE">  XE "KE selma’o"   If sumti were allowed to begin with “ke”, unavoidable ambiguities would result, so “ke” grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule does not apply to “tu'e” grouping of bridi, as <a href=#e8d6>Example 8.6 </a>shows.
<p>
<ex "German rich man">  XE "German rich man: example“  Now we have enough facilities to handle the problem of <a href=#e7d3>Example 7.3</a>: “I am German, rich, and a man — or else none of these.” The following paraphrase has the correct meaning:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d10>8.10)	 [tu'e] mi dotco .ijo mi ricfu [tu'u]
		.ije tu'e mi dotco  .ijo mi nanmu [tu'u]
	( I am-German if-and-only-if I am-rich )
		and ( I am-German if-and-only-if I am-a-man ).
</pre><p>The truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component sentences are true or all three are false.
<p>
<a name=s9><h3>Compound bridi</h3>
<p>
<cx "logical connection of selbri">  XE “logical connection: of selbri"   So far we have seen how to handle two sentences that need have no similarity at all (bridi connection) and sentences that are identical except for a difference in one sumti (sumti connection). It would seem natural to ask how to logically connect sentences that are identical except for having different selbri.
<p>
<cx "compound bridi, definition">  XE "compound bridi: definition"   Surprise! Lojban provides no logical connective that is designed to handle selbri and nothing else. Instead, selbri connection is provided as part of a more general-purpose mechanism called “compound bridi”. Compound bridi result from logically connecting sentences that differ in their selbri and possibly some of their sumti.
<p>
<cx "compound bridi, one sumti in common">  XE "compound bridi: one sumti in common"   The simplest cases result when the x1 sumti is the only common point:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	mi klama le zarci  .ije mi nelci la djan.
	I go to the market, and I like John.
</pre>is equivalent in meaning to the compound bridi:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d2>9.2)	mi klama le zarci gi'e nelci la djan.
	I go-to the market and like John.
</pre><cx "gihek, definition">  XE "gihek: definition"   <lx "gi'e">  XE "gi'e"   <cx "bridi-tail, definition">  XE "bridi-tail: definition"   <cx "compound bridi, logical connection of">  XE "compound bridi: logical connection of"   <lx "GIhA">  XE "GIhA selma’o"   As <a href=#e9d2>Example 9.2 </a>indicates, giheks are used in afterthought to create compound bridi; “gi'e” is the gihek corresponding to “and”. The actual phrases “klama le zarci” and “nelci la djan.” that the gihek connects are known as “bridi-tails”, because they represent (in this use) the “tail end” of a bridi, including the selbri and any following sumti, but excluding any sumti that precede the selbri:

<p>
<pre><a name=e9d3>9.3)	mi ricfu gi'e klama le zarci
	I am-rich and go-to the market.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e9d3>Example 9.3</a>, the first bridi-tail is “ricfu”, a simple selbri, and the second bridi-tail is “klama le zarci”, a selbri with one following sumti.
<p>
<cx "compound bridi, more than one sumti in common">  XE "compound bridi: more than one sumti in common"   Suppose that more than a single sumti is identical between the two sentences:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d4>9.4)	mi dunda le cukta do  .ije mi lebna lo rupnu do
	I give the book to-you, and I take some currency-units from-you.
</pre><cx "compound bridi with more than one sumti in common, with common sumti first">  XE "compound bridi with more than one sumti in common: with common sumti first"   In <a href=#e9d4>Example 9.4</a>, the first and last sumti of each bridi are identical; the selbri and the second sumti are different. By moving the final sumti to the beginning, a form analogous to <a href=#e9d2>Example 9.2 </a>can be achieved:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d5>9.5)	fi do fa mi dunda le cukta gi'e lebna lo rupnu
	To/from you I give the book and take some currency-units.
</pre><cx "logical connectives, bridi-tail connection">  XE "logical connectives: bridi-tail connection"   <cx "tail-terms, definition">  XE "tail-terms: definition"   where the “fi” does not have an exact English translation because it merely places “do” in the third place of both “lebna” and “dunda”. However, a form that preserves natural sumti order also exists in Lojban. Giheks connect two bridi-tails, but also allow sumti to be added following the bridi-tail. These sumti are known as tail-terms, and apply to both bridi. The straightforward gihek version of <a href=#e9d4>Example 9.4 </a>therefore is:
<p>
<lx "vau">  XE "vau"   <lx "VAU">  XE "VAU selma’o"   <cx "compound bridi with more than one sumti in common, with vau">  XE "compound bridi with more than one sumti in common: with vau"   <pre><a name=e9d6>9.6)	mi dunda le cukta gi'e lebna lo rupnu vau do
	I (give the book) and (take some currency-units) to/from you.
</pre><cx "bridi-tails, eliding vau in">  XE "bridi-tails: eliding vau in"   The “vau” (of selma'o VAU) serves to separate the bridi-tail from the tail-terms. Every bridi-tail is terminated by an elidable “vau”, but only in connection with compound bridi is it ever necessary to express this “vau”. Thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d7>9.7)	mi klama le zarci [vau]
	I go-to the market.
</pre>has a single elided “vau”, and <a href=#e9d2>Example 9.2 </a>is equivalent to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d8>9.8)	mi klama le zarci [vau] gi'e nelci la djan. [vau] [vau]
</pre>where the double “vau” at the end of <a href=#e9d8>Example 9.8 </a>terminates both the right-hand bridi-tail and the unexpressed tail-terms.
<p>
<cx "logical connectives, observative sentence connection">  XE "logical connectives: observative sentence connection"   A final use of giheks is to combine bridi-tails used as complete sentences, the Lojban observative:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d9>9.9)	klama le zarci gi'e dzukla le briju
	A goer to-the market and a walker to-the office.
</pre><cx "logical connection of observatives, relation of first places">  XE “logical connection: of observatives, relation of first places"   Since x1 is omitted in both of the bridi underlying <a href=#e9d9>Example 9.9</a>, this compound bridi does not necessarily imply that the goer and the walker are the same. Only the presence of an explicit x1 (other than “zo'e”, which is equivalent to omission) can force the goer and the walker to be identical.
<p>
<cx "relation of first places in logical connection of observatives, rationale">  XE "relation of first places in logical connection of observatives: rationale"   A strong argument for this convention is provided by analysis of the following example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d10>9.10)	 klama la nu,IORK. la finyks. gi'e klama la nu,IORK. la rom.
	A goer to-New York from-Phoenix and a goer to-New York from-Rome.
</pre><p>If the rule were that the x1 places of the two underlying bridi were identified, then (since there is nothing special about x1), the unspecified x4 (route) and x5 (means) places would also have to be the same, leading to the absurd result that the route from Phoenix to New York is the same as the route from Rome to New York. Inserting “da”, meaning roughly “something”, into the x1 place cures the problem:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d11>9.11)	da klama la nu,IORK. la finyks.
		gi'e klama la nu,IORK. la rom.
	Something is-a-goer to-New York from-Phoenix
		and is-a-goer to-New York from-Rome.

<a name=s10><h3>Multiple compound bridi</h3>
<p>
<cx "compound bridi, multiple with bo">  XE "compound bridi: multiple with bo"   Giheks can be combined with “bo” in the same way as eks:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d1>10.1)	mi nelci la djan. gi'e nelci la martas. gi'abo nelci la meris.
	I like John and ( like Martha or like Mary ).
</pre><cx "compound bridi, multiple with ke…ke'e">  XE "compound bridi: multiple with ke…ke'e"   is equivalent in meaning to <a href=#e8d1>Example 8.1 </a>and <a href=#e8d2>Example 8.2</a>. Likewise, “ke<dots>…</dots>ke'e” grouping can be used after giheks:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d2>10.2)	mi dzukla le zarci gi'e dzukla le zdani
		gi'a ke dzukla le ckule gi'e dzukla le briju [ke'e]
	I walk-to the market and walk-to the house,
		or walk-to the school and walk-to the office.
</pre><cx "multiple compound bridi, restriction on ke">  XE "multiple compound bridi: restriction on ke"   <cx "logical connection of bridi-tails, restriction on ke">  XE “logical connection: of bridi-tails, restriction on ke"   <lx "ke">  XE "ke"   <lx "KEhE">  XE "KEhE selma’o"   is the gihek version of <a href=#e8d9>Example 8.9</a>. The same rule about using “ke <dots>…</dots>ke'e” bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in <a href=#e10d2>Example 10.2 </a>cannot be explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.
<p>
<cx "compound bridi, separate tail-terms for bridi-tails">  XE "compound bridi: separate tail-terms for bridi-tails"   Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of tail-terms:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d3>10.3)	mi dejni lo rupnu la djan.  .inaja mi dunda le cukta la djan.
		.ijabo mi lebna le cukta la djan.
	[If] I owe some currency-units to John, then I give the book to John
		or I take the book from John.
</pre>is equivalent in meaning to:
<p>
<ex "owe money">  XE "owe money: example“  <pre><a name=e10d4>10.4)	mi dejni lo rupnu nagi'a dunda gi'abo lebna vau le cukta vau la djan.
	[If] I owe some currency-units then (give or take) 	a book to/from John.
</pre><p>The literal English translation in <a href=#e10d4>Example 10.4 </a>is almost unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. “mi” fills the x1 place of all three selbri; “lo rupnu” is the x2 of “dejni”, whereas “le cukta” is a tail-term shared between “dunda” and “lebna”; “la djan.” is a tail-term shared by “dejni” and by “dunda gi'abo lebna”. In this case, greater clarity is probably achieved by moving “la djan.” to the beginning of the sentence, as in <a href=#e9d5>Example 10.5</a>:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d5>10.5)	fi la djan. fa mi dejni lo rupnu nagi'a dunda gi'abo lebna vau le cukta
	To/from John, [if] I owe some currency-units then [I] give or take the book.
</pre><cx "logical connection of bridi-tails, forethought">  XE “logical connection: of bridi-tails, forethought"   Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d6>10.6)	mi ge klama le zarci gi nelci la djan.
	I both go to the market and like John.
</pre>is equivalent in meaning to <a href=#e9d2>Example 9.2</a>.
<p>
Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d7>10.7)	mi ge klama le zarci gi'e dzukla le zdani gi nelci la djan.
	I both ( go to the market and walk to the house ) and like John.

	[False!] I both go to the market and walk to the house.
</pre><cx "compound bridi, separate tail-terms for forethought-connected bridi-tails">  XE "compound bridi: separate tail-terms for forethought-connected bridi-tails"   Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of <a href=#e9d6>Example 9.6 </a>is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d9>10.9)	mi ge dunda le cukta  gi lebna lo rupnu vau do
	I both ( give the book ) and ( take some currency-units ) to/from you.
</pre><cx "forethought connection, observatives">  XE "forethought connection: observatives"   Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of <a href=#e9d9>Example 9.9</a>:

<pre><a name=e10d10>10.10)	ge klama le zarci gi dzukla le briju
	Both a goer to-the market and a walker to-the office.

Termset logical connectives are employed for sentences that differ in more than one sumti but not in the selbri, such as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d1>11.1)	I go to the market from the office and to the house from the school.
</pre><lx "ce'e">  XE "ce'e"   <lx "CEhE">  XE "CEhE selma’o"   <lx "pe'e">  XE "pe'e"   <lx "PEhE">  XE "PEhE selma’o"   <cx "term, definition">  XE "term: definition"   <cx "termset, formation">  XE "termset: formation"   <cx "logical connection, termsets">  XE "logical connection: termsets"   The Lojban version of <a href=#e11d1>Example 11.1 </a>requires two termsets joined by a logical connective. A “term” is either a sumti or a sumti preceded by a tense or modal tag such as “pu” or “bai”. Afterthought termsets are formed by linking terms together by inserting the cmavo “ce'e” (of selma'o CEhE) between each of them. Furthermore, the logical connective (which is a jek) must be prefixed by the cmavo “pe'e” (of selma'o PEhE). (We could refer to the combination of “pe'e” and a jek as a “pehejek”, I suppose.)
<p>
<cx "to the market from the office">  XE "to the market from the office"   <pre><a name=e11d2>11.2)	mi klama le zarci ce'e le briju pe'e je
		le zdani ce'e le ckule
	I go to-the market [plus] from-the office [joint] and
		to-the house [plus] from-the school.
</pre><p>The literal translation uses “[plus]” to indicate the termset connective, and “[joint]” to indicate the position of the logical connective joint. As usual, there is an equivalent bridi-connection form:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d3>11.3)	mi klama le zarci le briju  .ije mi klama le zdani le ckule
	I go to-the market from-the office, and I go to-the house from-the school.
</pre>which illustrates that the two bridi differ in the x2 and x3 places only.
<p>
<cx "termset logical connection, unequal length">  XE "termset logical connection: unequal length"   What happens if the two joined sets of terms are of unequal length? Expanding to bridi connection will always make clear which term goes in which place of which bridi. It can happen that a sumti may fall in the x2 place of one bridi and the x3 place of another:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d4>11.4)	mi pe'e ja do ce'e le zarci cu klama le briju
	I [joint] or you to-the market [plus] go to/from-the office.
</pre>can be clearly understood by expansion to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d5>11.5)	mi klama le briju  .ija do le zarci cu klama le briju
	I go to-the office, or you to-the market go from-the office.
</pre><cx "unequal termset connection, compared with compound bridi connection with unequal separate bridi-tails">  XE "unequal termset connection: compared with compound bridi connection with unequal separate bridi-tails"   So “le briju” is your origin but my destination, and thus falls in the x2 and x3 places of “klama” simultaneously! This is legal because even though there is only one selbri, “klama”, there are two distinct bridi expressed here. In addition, “mi” in <a href=#e11d4>Example 11.4 </a>is serving as a termset containing only one term. An analogous paradox applies to compound bridi with tail-terms and unequal numbers of sumti within the connected bridi-tails:

Nothing is inserted between the individual terms: they simply sit side-by-side. To make a logical connection in a forethought termset, use a gek, with the gek just after the “nu'i”, and an extra “nu'u” just before the gik:

<a name=s12><h3>Logical connection within tanru</h3>
<p>
<cx "logical connectives in tanru">  XE "logical connectives in tanru"   As noted at the beginning of <a href=#s9>Section 9</a>, there is no logical connective in Lojban that joins selbri and nothing but selbri. However, it is possible to have logical connectives within a selbri, forming a kind of tanru that involves a logical connection. Consider the simple tanru “blanu zdani”, blue house. Now anything that is a blue ball, in the most ordinary understanding of the phrase at least, is both blue and a ball. And indeed, instead of “blanu bolci”, Lojbanists can say “blanu je bolci”, using a jek connective within the tanru. (We saw jeks used in <a href=#s11>Section 11 </a>also, but there they were always prefixed by “pe'e”; in this section they are used alone.) Here is a pair of examples:
<p>
<ex "blue house">  XE "blue house: example“  <pre><a name=e12d1>12.1)	ti blanu zdani
	This is-a-blue type-of house.
<a name=e12d2>12.2)	ti blanu je zdani
	This is-blue and a-house.
</pre><cx "logical connection in tanru, contrasted with unconnected version">  XE “logical connection: in tanru, contrasted with unconnected version"   <cx "unconnected tanru, contrasted with logically connected version">  XE "unconnected tanru: contrasted with logically connected version"   But of course <a href=#e12d1>Example 12.1 </a>and <a href=#e12d2>Example 12.2 </a>are not necessarily equivalent in meaning! It is the most elementary point about Lojban tanru that <a href=#e12d1>Example 12.1 </a>might just as well mean
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d3>12.3)	This is a house for blue inhabitants.
</pre>and <a href=#e12d2>Example 12.2 </a>certainly is not equivalent in meaning to <a href=#e12d3>Example 12.3</a>.
<p>
<cx "logical connection in tanru, expandability of">  XE “logical connection: in tanru, expandability of"   A full explanation of logical connection within tanru belongs rather to a discussion of selbri structure than to logical connectives in general. Why? Because although <a href=#e12d2>Example 12.2 </a>happens to mean the same as
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d4>12.4)	ti blanu gi'e zdani
</pre>and therefore as
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d5>12.5)	ti blanu  .ije ti zdani
</pre>the rule of expansion into separate bridi simply does not always work for tanru connection. Supposing Alice to be a person who lives in blue houses, then
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d6>12.6)	la .alis. cu blanu je zdani prenu
	Alice is-a ( blue and house ) type-of-person.
</pre>would be true, because tanru grouping with a jek has higher precedence than unmarked tanru grouping, but:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d7>12.7)	la .alis. cu blanu prenu  .ije la .alis. cu zdani prenu
	Alice is-a blue person, and Alice is-a house person.
</pre>is probably false, because the blueness is associated with the house, not with Alice, even leaving aside the question of what it means to say “Alice is a blue person”. (Perhaps she belongs to the Blue team, or is wearing blue clothes.) The semantic ambiguity of tanru make such logical manipulations impossible.

<p>
<a name=s13><h3>Truth questions and connective questions</h3>
<p>
So far we have addressed only sentences which are statements. Lojban, like all human languages, needs also to deal with sentences which are questions. There are many ways of asking questions in Lojban, but some of these (like questions about quantity, tense, and emotion) are discussed in other chapters.
<p>
<cx "truth questions, simple">  XE "truth questions: simple"   The simplest kind of question is of the type “Is it true that <dots>…</dots>” where some statement follows. This type is called a “truth question”, and can be represented in English by <a href=#e13d1>Example 13.1</a>:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d1>13.1)	Is it true that Fido is a dog?
	Is Fido a dog?
</pre><lx "xu">  XE "xu"   <lx "UI">  XE "UI selma’o"   Note the two formulations. English truth questions can always be formed by prefixing “Is is true that” to the beginning of a statement; there is also usually a more idiomatic way involving putting the verb before its subject. “Is Alice a dog?” is the truth question corresponding to “Alice is a dog”. In Lojban, the equivalent mechanism is to prefix the cmavo “xu” (of selma'o UI) to the statement:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d2>13.2)	xu la faidon. gerku
	is-it-true-that Fido is-a-dog?
</pre><a href=#e13d1>Example 13.1 </a>and <a href=#e13d2>Example 13.2 </a>are equivalent in meaning.
<p>
<cx "truth questions, as yes-or-no questions">  XE "truth questions: as yes-or-no questions"   <cx "truth questions, answering “yes”">  XE "truth questions: answering \“yes\”"   <cx "truth questions, answering “no”">  XE "truth questions: answering \“no\”"   A truth question can be answered “yes” or “no”, depending on the truth or falsity, respectively, of the underlying statement. The standard way of saying “yes” in Lojban is “go'i” and of saying “no” is “nago'i”. (The reasons for this rule are explained in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7</a>.) In answer to <a href=#e13d2>Example 13.2</a>, the possible answers are:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d3>13.3)	go'i
	Fido is a dog.
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d4>13.4)	nago'i
	Fido is not a dog.
</pre><cx "truth questions, contrasted with connection questions">  XE "truth questions: contrasted with connection questions"   Some English questions seemingly have the same form as the truth questions so far discussed. Consider
<p>
<ex "dog or cat">  XE "dog or cat: example“  <pre><a name=e13d5>13.5)	Is Fido a dog or a cat?
</pre><p>Superficially, <a href=#e13d5>Example 13.5 </a>seems like a truth question with the underlying statement:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d6>13.6)	Fido is a dog or a cat.
</pre><p>By translating <a href=#e13d6>Example 13.6 </a>into Lojban and prefixing “xu” to signal a truth question, we get:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d7>13.7)	xu la faidon. gerku gi'onai mlatu
	is-it-true-that Fido is-a-dog or is-a-cat (but not both)?
</pre><p>Given that Fido really is either a dog or a cat, the appropriate answer would be “go'i”; if Fido were a fish, the appropriate answer would be “nago'i”.
<p>
But that is not what an English-speaker who utters <a href=#e13d5>Example 13.5 </a>is asking! The true significance of <a href=#e13d5>Example 13.5 </a>is that the speaker desires to know the truth value of either of the two underlying bridi (it is presupposed that only one is true).
<p>
<cx "questions, connection">  XE "questions: connection"   Lojban has an elegant mechanism for rendering this kind of question which is very unlike that used in English. Instead of asking about the truth value of the connected bridi, Lojban users ask about the truth function which connects them. This is done by using a special question cmavo: there is one of these for each of the logical connective selma'o, as shown by the following table:

<p>
<lx "ge'i">  XE "ge'i"   <lx "gi'i">  XE "gi'i"   <lx "gu'i">  XE "gu'i"   <lx "je'i">  XE "je'i"   <lx "ji">  XE "ji"   <lx "GA">  XE "GA selma’o"   <lx "GIhA">  XE "GIhA selma’o"   <lx "GUhA">  XE "GUhA selma’o"   <lx "JA">  XE "JA selma’o"   <lx "A">  XE “A selma’o"   <pre> 	ge'i	GA	forethought connective question
	gi'i	GIhA	bridi-tail connective question
	gu'i	GUhA	tanru forethought connective question
	je'i	JA	tanru connective question
	ji	A	sumti connective question
</pre><cx "connective question cmavo, departure from regularity of">  XE "connective question cmavo: departure from regularity of"   (This list unfortunately departs from the pretty regularity of the other cmavo for logical connection. The two-syllable selma'o, GIhA and GUhA, make use of the cmavo ending in “-i” which is not used for a truth function, but “gi” and “.i” were not available, and different cmavo had to be chosen. This table must simply be memorized, like most other non-connective cmavo assignments.)
<p>
<cx "connective questions, answering">  XE "connective questions: answering"   One correct translation of <a href=#e13d5>Example 13.5 </a>employs a question gihek:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d8>13.8)	la .alis gerku gi'i mlatu
	Alice is-a-dog [truth function?] is-a-cat?
</pre><p>Here are some plausible answers:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d9>13.9)	nagi'e
	Alice is not a dog and is a cat.
<a name=e13d10>13.10)	gi'enai
	Alice is a dog and is not a cat.
<a name=e13d11>13.11)	nagi'enai
	Alice is not a dog and is not a cat.
<a name=e13d12>13.12)	nagi'o
	gi'onai
	Alice is a dog or is a cat but not both (I'm not saying which).
</pre><a href=#e13d12>Example 13.12 </a>is correct but uncooperative.
<p>
<cx "connective, as complete grammatical utterance">  XE "connective(s): as complete grammatical utterance"   <cx "afterthought connective, as complete grammatical utterance">  XE "afterthought connective(s): as complete grammatical utterance"   As usual, Lojban questions are answered by filling in the blank left by the question. Here the blank is a logical connective, and therefore it is grammatical in Lojban to utter a bare logical connective without anything for it to connect.
<p>
The answer “gi'e”, meaning that Alice is a dog and is a cat, is impossible in the real world, but for:
<p>
<ex "coffee or tea">  XE "coffee or tea: example“  <pre><a name=e13d13>13.13)	do djica tu'a loi ckafi
		ji loi tcati
	You desire something-about a-mass-of coffee 
		[truth function?] a-mass-of tea?
	Do you want coffee or tea?
</pre>the answer “.e”, meaning that I want both, is perfectly plausible, if not necessarily polite.
<p>
<cx "connective, as ungrammatical utterance">  XE "connective(s): as ungrammatical utterance"   <cx "forethought connective, as ungrammatical utterance">  XE "forethought connective(s): as ungrammatical utterance"   <cx "forethought connection, contrasted with afterthought for grammatical utterances">  XE "forethought connection: contrasted with afterthought for grammatical utterances"   <cx "afterthought connection, contrasted with forethought for grammatical utterances">  XE "afterthought connection: contrasted with forethought for grammatical utterances"   The forethought questions “ge'i” and “gu'i” are used like the others, but ambiguity forbids the use of isolated forethought connectives as answers — they sound like the start of forethought-connected bridi. So although <a href=#e13d14>Example 13.14 </a>is the forethought version of <a href=#e13d13>Example 13.13</a>:

<p>
<pre><a name=e13d14>13.14)	do djica tu'a
		ge'i loi ckafi gi loi tcati
	You desire something-about 
		[truth function?] a-mass-of coffee [or] a-mass-of tea?
</pre>the answer must be in afterthought form.
<p>
<cx "connective questions, compared with other languages">  XE "connective questions: compared with other languages"   There are natural languages, notably Chinese, which employ the Lojbanic form of connective question. The Chinese sentence
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d15>13.15)	ni<sup>3</sup> zou<sup>3</sup> hai<sup>2</sup>shi pao<sup>3</sup>
	you walk [or?] run?
</pre>means “Do you walk or run?”, and is exactly parallel to the Lojban:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d16>13.16)	do cadzu gi'i bajra
	you walk [or?] run?
</pre><cx "connective question answers, contrasted with other languages">  XE "connective question answers: contrasted with other languages"   However, Chinese does not use logical connectives in the reply to such a question, so the resemblance, though striking, is superficial.
<p>
<cx "bridi connection, use of truth questions in">  XE "bridi connection: use of truth questions in"   <cx "bridi connection, use of imperatives in">  XE "bridi connection: use of imperatives in"   <cx "truth, in imperative sentences">  XE "truth: in imperative sentences"   <cx "imperatives, and truth">  XE "imperatives: and truth"   <ex "Abraham Lincoln">  XE "Abraham Lincoln: example“  <ex "if coffee, bring tea">  XE "if coffee: bring tea, example“  Truth questions may be used in bridi connection. This form of sentence is perfectly legitimate, and can be interpreted by using the convention that a truth question is true if the answer is “yes” and false if the answer is “no”. Analogously, an imperative sentence (involving the special pro-sumti “ko”, which means “you” but marks the sentence as a command) is true if the command is obeyed, and false otherwise. A request of Abraham Lincoln's may be translated thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d17>13.17)	ganai ti ckafi gi ko bevri loi tcati mi
		.ije ganai ti tcati gi ko bevri loi ckafi mi
	If this is-coffee then [you!] bring a-mass-of tea to-me,
		and if this is-tea then [you!] bring a-mass-of coffee to-me.
	If this is coffee, bring me tea; but if this is tea, bring me coffee.
</pre><cx "but, compared with and">  XE "but: compared with and"   <cx "and, compared with but">  XE "and: compared with but"   <lx "ku'i">  XE "ku'i"   <lx "UI">  XE "UI selma’o"   In logical terms, however, “but” is the same as “and”; the difference is that the sentence after a “but” is felt to be in tension or opposition to the sentence before it. Lojban represents this distinction by adding the discursive cmavo “ku'i” (of selma'o UI), which is explained in <a href=chap13.html>Chapter 13</a>, to the logical “.ije”.)
<p>
<a name=s14><h3>Non-logical connectives</h3>
<p>
<cx "and, as non-logical connective">  XE "and: as non-logical connective"   Way back in <a href=#s1>Section 1</a>, the point was made that not every use of English “and”, “if <dots>…</dots>then”, and so on represents a Lojban logical connective. In particular, consider the “and” of:
<p>
<ex "carried piano">  XE "carried piano: example“  <pre><a name=e14d1>14.1)	John and Alice carried the piano.
</pre><cx "mass, joining elements into a">  XE "mass: joining elements into a"   Given the nature of pianos, this probably means that John carried one end and Alice the other. So it is not true that:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d2>14.2)	John carried the piano, and Alice carried the piano.
</pre><lx "joi">  XE "joi"   <lx "JOI">  XE "JOI selma’o"   which would mean that each of them carried the piano by himself/herself. Lojban deals with this particular linguistic phenomenon as a “mass”. John and Alice are joined together into a mass, John-and-Alice, and it is this mass which carried the piano, not either of them separately. The cmavo “joi” (of selma'o JOI) is used to join two or more components into a mass:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d3>14.3)	la djan. joi la .alis. cu bevri le pipno
	John massed-with Alice carry the piano.
</pre><cx "supervising, as a contribution to mass action">  XE "supervising: as a contribution to mass action"   <cx "mass contrasted with components, in properties of">  XE "mass contrasted with components: in properties of"   <cx "components contrasted with mass, in properties of">  XE "components contrasted with mass: in properties of"   <a href=#e14d3>Example 14.3 </a>covers the case mentioned, where John and Alice divide the labor; it also could mean that John did all the hauling and Alice did the supervising. This possibility arises because the properties of a mass are the properties of its components, which can lead to apparent contradictions: if John is small and Alice is large, then John-and-Alice is both small and large. Masses are also discussed in <a href=chap6.html>Chapter 6</a>.

This flexibility must be paid for in the form of occasional terminators that cannot be elided:
<p>

	The man massed-with the woman go-to the market.
</pre><p>The cmavo “ku” is the elidable terminator for “le”, which can almost always be elided, but not in this case. If the first “ku” were elided here, Lojban's parsing rules would see “le nanmu joi” and assume that another tanru component is to follow; since the second “le” cannot be part of a tanru, a parsing error results. No such problem can occur with logical connectives, because an ek signals a following sumti and a jek a following tanru component unambiguously.
<p>
<cx "joik, definition">  XE "joik: definition"   <lx "JOI">  XE "JOI selma’o"   Single or compound cmavo involving members of selma'o JOI are called joiks, by analogy with the names for logical connectives. It is not grammatical to use joiks to connect bridi-tails.

<p>
There are several other cmavo in selma'o JOI which can be used in the same grammatical constructions. Not all of them are well-defined as yet in all contexts. All have clear definitions as sumti connectives; those definitions are shown in the following table:

<lx "JOI">  XE "JOI selma’o"   <lx "joi">  XE "joi"   <lx "ce">  XE "ce"   <lx "ce'o">  XE "ce'o"   <lx "sece'o">  XE "sece'o"   <lx "jo'u">  XE "jo'u"   <lx "fa'u">  XE "fa'u"   <lx "sefa'u">  XE "sefa'u"   <lx "jo'e">  XE "jo'e"   <lx "ku'a">  XE "ku'a"   <lx "pi'u">  XE "pi'u"   <lx "sepi'u">  XE "sepi'u"   <lx "se">  XE "se"   <pre> 	A joi B	the mass with components A and B

</pre><cx "se, as grammatical in JOI compounds">  XE "se: as grammatical in JOI compounds"   <cx "joiks, use of “se” in">  XE "joiks: use of \“se\” in"   <lx "JOI">  XE "JOI selma’o"   The cmavo “se” is grammatical before any JOI cmavo, but only useful with those that have inherent order. Here are some examples of joiks:
<p>
<ex "choose from">  XE "choose from: example“  <pre><a name=e14d6>14.6)	mi cuxna la .alis. la frank. ce la .alis. ce la djeimyz.
	I choose Alice from Frank and-member Alice and-member James.
	I choose Alice from among Frank, Alice, and James.
</pre><cx "set, as specified by members">  XE "set: as specified by members"   <cx "set, contrasted with mass in distribution of properties">  XE "set: contrasted with mass in distribution of properties"   <cx "mass, contrasted with set in distribution of properties">  XE "mass: contrasted with set in distribution of properties"   The x3 place of “cuxna” is a set from which the choice is being made. A set is an abstract object which is determined by specifying its members. Unlike those of a mass, the properties of a set are unrelated to its members' properties: the set of all rats is large (since many rats exist), but the rats themselves are small. This chapter does not attempt to explain set theory (the mathematical study of sets) in detail: explaining propositional logic is quite enough for one chapter!
<p>
<lx "ce">  XE "ce"   <cx "set, by listing members with ce">  XE "set: by listing members with ce"   In <a href=#e14d6>Example 14.6 </a>we specify that set by listing the members with “ce” joining them.
<p>
<ex "list">  XE "list: example“  <pre><a name=e14d7>14.7)	ti liste mi ce'o do ce'o la djan.
	This is-a-list-of me and-sequence you and-sequence John.
	This is a list of you, me, and John.
</pre><cx "list, contrasted with sequence">  XE "list: contrasted with sequence"   <cx "sequence, contrasted with list">  XE "sequence: contrasted with list"   <cx "list, as a physical object">  XE "list: as a physical object"   <cx "sequence, as an abstract list">  XE "sequence: as an abstract list"   <cx "ordered sequence, by listing members">  XE "ordered sequence: by listing members"   <cx "ordered sequence, contrasted with set">  XE "ordered sequence: contrasted with set"   <cx "ordered sequence, contrasted with mass">  XE "ordered sequence: contrasted with mass"   <cx "mass, contrasted with ordered sequence">  XE "mass: contrasted with ordered sequence"   <cx "set, contrasted with ordered sequence">  XE "set: contrasted with ordered sequence"   The x2 place of “liste” is a sequence of the things which are mentioned in the list. (It is worth pointing out that “lo liste” means a physical object such as a grocery list: a purely abstract list is “lo porsi”, a sequence.) Here the three sumti connected by “ce'o” are in a definite order, not just lumped together in a set or a mass.
<p>
<cx "non-logical connection, of individuals into mass">  XE "non-logical connection: of individuals into mass"   <cx "non-logical connection, of individuals into set">  XE "non-logical connection: of individuals into set"   <cx "individuals into mass, by non-logical connection">  XE "individuals into mass: by non-logical connection"   <cx "individuals into set, by non-logical connection">  XE "individuals into set: by non-logical connection"   <lx "jo'u">  XE "jo'u"   <cx "jo'u, contrasted with joi">  XE "jo'u: contrasted with joi"   <cx "jo'u, contrasted with ce">  XE "jo'u: contrasted with ce"   <cx "jo'u, contrasted with ce'o">  XE "jo'u: contrasted with ce'o"   <cx "jo'u, result of connection with">  XE "jo'u: result of connection with"   So “joi”, “ce”, and “ce'o” are parallel, in that the sumti connected are taken to be individuals, and the result is something else: a mass, a set, or a sequence respectively. The cmavo “jo'u” serves as a fourth element in this pattern: the sumti connected are individuals, and the result is still individuals — but inseparably so. The normal Lojban way of saying that James and George are brothers is:
<p>
<ex "brothers">  XE "brothers: example“  <pre><a name=e14d8>14.8)	la djeimyz. bruna la djordj.
	James is-the-brother-of George.
</pre>possibly adding a discursive element meaning “and vice versa”. However, “James and George are brothers” cannot be correctly translated as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d9>14.9)	la djeimyz. .e la djordj. bruna
	James and George is-a-brother.
</pre>since that expands to two bridi and means that James is a brother and so is George, but not necessarily of each other. If the “.e” is changed to “jo'u”, however, the meaning of <a href=#e14d8>Example 14.8 </a>is preserved:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d10>14.10)	la djeimyz. jo'u la djordj. cu remei bruna
	James in-common-with George are-a-twosome type-of-brothers.
</pre><p>The tanru “remei bruna” is not strictly necessary in this sentence, but is used to make clear that we are not saying that James and George are both brothers of some third person not specified. Alternatively, we could turn the tanru around: the x1 place of “remei” is a mass with two components, leading to:
<p>
<lx "joi">  XE "joi"   <pre><a name=e14d11>14.11)	la djeimyz. joi la djordj. cu bruna remei
	James massed-with George are-a-brother type-of-twosome.
</pre>where “joi” is used to create the necessary mass.
<p>
<lx "fa'u">  XE "fa'u"   <cx "connection, non-distributed">  XE "connection: non-distributed"   <cx "respectively, specifying with fa'u">  XE "respectively: specifying with fa'u"   <ex "respectively">  XE "respectively: example“  Likewise, “fa'u” can be used to put two individuals together where order matters. Typically, there will be another “fa'u” somewhere else in the same bridi:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d12>14.12)	la djeimyz. fa'u la djordj. prami la meris. fa'u la martas.
	James jointly-in-order-with George loves Mary jointly-in-order-with Martha.
	James and George love Mary and Martha, respectively.
</pre><cx "fa'u, contrasted with .e">  XE "fa'u: contrasted with .e"   <cx ".e, contrasted with fa'u">  XE "e: contrasted with fa'u"   Here the information carried by the English adverb “respectively”, namely that James loves Mary and George loves Martha, is divided between the two occurrences of “fa'u”. If both uses of “fa'u” were to be changed to “.e”, we would get:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d13>14.13)	la djeimyz. .e la djordj. prami la meris. .e la martas.
	James and George love Mary and Martha.
</pre>which can be transformed to four bridi:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d14>14.14)	la djeimyz. prami la meris.  .ije la djordj. prami la meris.
		.ije la djeimyz. prami la martas.  .ije la djordj. prami la martas.
	James loves Mary, and George loves Mary,
		and James loves Martha, and George loves Martha.
</pre>which represents quite a different state of affairs from <a href=#e14d12>Example 14.12</a>. The meaning of <a href=#e14d12>Example 14.12 </a>can also be conveyed by a termset:
<p>
<cx "fa'u, compared to termsets">  XE "fa'u: compared to termsets"   <cx "termsets, compared to fa'u">  XE "termsets: compared to fa'u"   <pre><a name=e14d15>14.15)	la djeimyz. ce'e la meris. pe'e .e la djordj. ce'e la martas. prami
	James [plus] Mary [joint] and George [plus] Martha loves.
</pre>at the expense of re-ordering the list of names so as to make the pairs explicit. This option is not available when one of the lists is only described rather than enumerated:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d16>14.16)	la djeimyz. fa'u la djordj. prami re sorme
	James and-respectively George love two sisters.
</pre>which conveys that James loves one sister and George the other, though we are not able to tell which of the sisters is which.
<p>
<a name=s15><h3>More about non-logical connectives</h3>
<p>
<lx "jo'e">  XE "jo'e"   <lx "ku'a">  XE "ku'a"   <lx "pi'u">  XE "pi'u"   <cx "set operations">  XE "set operations"   <cx "union, of sets">  XE "union: of sets"   <cx "intersection, of sets">  XE "intersection: of sets"   <cx "cross-product, of sets">  XE "cross-product: of sets"   The final three JOI cmavo, “jo'e”, “ku'a”, and “pi'u”, are probably only useful when talking explicitly about sets. They represent three standard set operators usually called “union”, “intersection”, and “cross product” (also known as “Cartesian product”). The union of two sets is a set containing all the members that are in either set; the intersection of two sets is a set containing all the members that are in both sets. The cross product of two sets is the set of all possible ordered pairs, where each ordered pair contains a single element from the first set followed by a single element from the second. This may seem very abstract; hopefully, the following examples will help:
<p>
<ex "rich and German">  XE "rich and German: example“  <pre><a name=e15d1>15.1)	lo'i ricfu ku jo'e lo'i dotco cu barda
	The-set-of rich-things union the-set-of German-things is large.
<a name=e15d2>15.2)	lo'i ricfu ku ku'a lo'i dotco cu cmalu
	The set-of rich-things intersection the-set-of German-things is small.

</pre><cx "union of sets, compared with or">  XE "union of sets: compared with or"   <cx "intersection of sets, compared with and">  XE "intersection of sets: compared with and"   There is a parallelism between logic and set theory that makes <a href=#e15d1>Example 15.1 </a>and <a href=#e15d2>Example 15.2 </a>equivalent respectively to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d3>15.3)	lo'i ricfu ja dotco cu barda
	The-set-of rich-or-German-things is large.
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d4>15.4)	lo'i ricfu je dotco cu cmalu
	The-set-of rich-and-German-things is small.
</pre><p>The following example uses “se remei”, which is a set (not a mass) of two elements:
<p>
<cx "pi'u, contrasted with .e">  XE "pi'u: contrasted with .e"   <cx "e, contrasted with pi'u">  XE "e: contrasted with pi'u"   <cx "cross-product, contrasted with and">  XE "cross-product: contrasted with and"   <cx "and, contrasted with cross-product">  XE "and: contrasted with cross-product"   <pre><a name=e15d5>15.5)	la djeimyz. ce[bo] la djordj. pi'u la meris. cebo la martas.
		cu prami se remei
	James and-set George cross-product Mary and-set Martha 
		are-lover type-of-pairs.
</pre>means that each of the pairs James/Mary, George/Mary, James/Martha, and George/Martha love each other. Therefore it is similar in meaning to <a href=#e14d13>Example 14.13</a>; however, that example speaks only of the men loving the women, not vice versa.

<cx "joiks, grouping">  XE "joiks: grouping"   <lx "JOI">  XE "JOI selma’o"   <cx "non-logical connectives, grouping">  XE "non-logical connectives: grouping"   Joiks may be combined with “bo” or with “ke” in the same way as eks and jeks; this allows grouping of non-logical connections between sumti and tanru units, in complete parallelism with logical connections:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d6>15.6)	mi joibo do ce la djan. joibo la djein.

	(I massed-with you) and (John massed-with Jane)

<p>
<cx "non-logical connection, of termsets">  XE "non-logical connection: of termsets"   <cx "termsets, non-logical connection of">  XE "termsets: non-logical connection of"   Non-logical connection is permitted at the joint of a termset; this is useful for associating more than one sumti or tagged sumti with each side of the non-logical connection. The place structure of “casnu” is:
<p>
<dl compact><dt>casnu:  <dd>the mass x1 discusses/talks about x2
</dl>so the x1 place must be occupied by a mass (for reasons not explained here); however, different components of the mass may discuss in different languages. To associate each participant with his or her language, we can say:
<p>
<ex "discuss in language">  XE "discuss in language: example“  <pre><a name=e15d7>15.7)	 mi ce'e bau la lojban.

</pre><p>Like all non-logical connectives, the usage shown in <a href=#e15d7>Example 15.7 </a>cannot be mechanically converted into a non-logical connective placed at another location in the bridi. The forethought equivalent of <a href=#e15d7>Example 15.7 </a>is:
<p>

<p>
<pre><a name=e15d9>15.9)	la djan. fa'u la frank. cusku nu'i bau la lojban.

	John and Frank speak in Lojban and under George's compulsion, respectively.
</pre><a href=#e14d17>Example 14.17 </a>associates speaking in Lojban with John, and speaking under George's compulsion with Frank. We do not know what language Frank uses, or whether John speaks under anyone's compulsion.

The ijoik “.ice'o” indicates that the event of the second bridi follows that of the first bridi in some way other than a time relationship (which is handled with a tense):

The order is important, hence the need for a sequence connective, but does not necessarily represent a time order (the dog may end up getting walked first). Note the use of “tu'e” and “tu'u” as general brackets around the whole list. This is related to, but distinct from, their use in <a href=#s8>Section 8</a>, because there is no logical connective between the introductory phrase “mi ba gasnu la'edi'e” and the rest. The brackets effectively show how large an utterance the word “di'e”, which means “the following utterance”, refers to.
Similarly, “.ijoi” is used to connect sentences that represent the components of a joint event such as a joint cause: the Lojban equivalent of “Fran hit her head and fell out of the boat, so that she drowned” would join the events “Fran hit her head” and “Fran fell out of the boat” with “.ijoi”.

<p>
<pre><a name=e15d11>15.11)	mi jo'unai do cu remei
	I in-common-with [not!] you are-a-twosome

<cx "connective questions, non-logical">  XE "connective questions: non-logical"   <cx "connective answers, non-logical">  XE "connective answers: non-logical"   There is no joik question cmavo as such; however, joiks and ijoiks may be uttered in isolation in response to a logical connective question, as in the following exchange:

The first two cmavo are used to specify intervals: abstract objects defined by two endpoints. The cmavo “bi'i” is correct if the endpoints are independent of order, whereas “bi'o” or “sebi'o” are used when order matters.
<p>
An example of “bi'i” in sumti connection:
<p>
<ex "between Dresden and Frankfurt">  XE "between Dresden and Frankfurt: example“  <lx "bi'i">  XE "bi'i"   <pre><a name=e16d1>16.1)	mi ca sanli la drezdn. bi'i la frankfurt.

</pre><cx "non-logical connectives, un-ordered intervals">  XE "non-logical connectives: un-ordered intervals"   In <a href=#e16d1>Example 16.1</a>, it is all the same whether I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt or between Frankfurt and Dresden, so “bi'i” is the appropriate interval connective. The sumti “la drezdn. bi'i la frankfurt.” falls into the x2 place of “sanli”, which is the surface I stand on; the interval specifies that surface by its limits. (Obviously, I am not standing on the whole of the interval; the x2 place of “sanli” specifies a surface which is typically larger in extent than just the size of the stander's feet.)
<p>

</pre><cx "non-logical connectives, ordered intervals">  XE "non-logical connectives: ordered intervals"   In <a href=#e16d2>Example 16.2</a>, on the other hand, it is essential that “la pacac.” comes before “la recac.”; otherwise we have an 11-hour (or 23-hour) interval rather than a one-hour interval. In this use of an interval, the whole interval is probably intended, or at least most of it.
<p>
<a href=#e16d2>Example 16.2 </a>is equivalent to:
<p>
<lx "sebi'o">  XE "sebi'o"   <pre><a name=e16d3>16.3)	mi cadzu ca la recac. sebi'o la pacac.

<lx "mi'i">  XE "mi'i"   <cx "intervals, expressed as center and distance">  XE "interval: expressed as center and distance"   The third cmavo of selma'o BIhI, namely “mi'i”, expresses an interval seen from a different viewpoint: not a pair of endpoints, but a center point and a distance. For example:

Yes. The connectives of selma'o BIhI are ambiguous about whether the endpoints themselves are included in or excluded from the interval. Two auxiliary cmavo “ga'o” and “ke'i” (of cmavo GAhO) are used to indicate the status of the endpoints: “ga'o” means that the endpoint is included, “ke'i” that it is excluded:

Mathematical expressions are explained fully in <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18</a>. The basic components of mekso are operands, like “2”, and operators, like “+”. Both of these may be either logically or non-logically connected.
<p>

Operators, on the other hand, are connected in afterthought with jeks and in forethought with guheks, just like tanru components. (However, jeks and joiks with “bo” are not allowed for operators.) This parallelism is no accident.

<p>
Only a few examples of each kind of mekso connection will be given. Despite the large number of rules required to support this feature, it is of relatively minor importance in either the mekso or the logical-connective scheme of things. These examples are drawn from <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18</a>, and contain many mekso features not explained in this chapter.
<p>
<a href=#e17d1>Example 17.1 </a>exhibits afterthought logical connection between operands:
<p>
<ex "three of four people">  XE "three of four people: example“  <pre><a name=e17d1>17.1)	vei ci .a vo [ve'o] prenu cu klama le zarci
	( Three or four ) people go-to the market.

</pre><a href=#e17d2>Example 17.2 </a>is equivalent in meaning, but uses forethought connection:
<p>
<pre><a name=e17d2>17.2)	vei ga ci gi vo [ve'o] prenu cu klama le zarci
	( Either 3 or 4 ) people go-to the market.
</pre><lx "ve'o">  XE "ve'o"   Note that the mekso in <a href=#e17d1>Example 17.1 </a>and <a href=#e17d2>Example 17.2 </a>are being used as quantifiers. Lojban requires that any mekso other than a simple number be enclosed in “vei” and “ve'o” parentheses when used as a quantifier. The right parenthesis mark, “ve'o”, is an elidable terminator.
<p>
Simple examples of logical connection between operators are hard to come by. A contrived example is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e17d3>17.3)	li re su'i je pi'i re du li vo
	The-number 2 plus and times 2 equals the-number 4.
	2 + 2 = 4 and 2 x 2 = 4.
</pre><p>The forethought form of <a href=#e17d3>Example 17.3 </a>is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e17d4>17.4)	li re ge su'i gi pi'i re du li vo
	The-number two both plus and times two equals the-number four.
	Both 2 + 2 = 4 and 2 x 2 = 4.
</pre><cx "mathematical intervals">  XE "mathematical intervals"   <lx "bi'i">  XE "bi'i"   <lx "ga'o">  XE "ga'o"   <lx "ke'i">  XE "ke'i"   Non-logical connection with joiks or joigiks is also permitted between operands and between operators. One use for this construct is to connect operands with “bi'i” to create mathematical intervals:
<p>
<ex "zero to one">  XE "zero to one: example“  <pre><a name=e17d5>17.5)	li no ga'o bi'i ke'i pa
	the-number zero (inclusive) from-to (exclusive) one
	[0,1)
	the numbers from zero to one, including zero but not including one
</pre><cx "compound subscript">  XE "compound subscript"   <lx "ce'o">  XE "ce'o"   You can also combine two operands with “ce'o”, the sequence connective of selma'o JOI, to make a compound subscript:
<p>
<ex "x{b,d}">  XE "x{b:d}, example“  <pre><a name=e17d6>17.6)	xy. boi xi vei by. ce'o dy. [ve'o]
	“x” sub (“b” sequence “d” )
	x<sub>b,d</sub>
</pre><lx "boi">  XE "boi"   Note that the “boi” in <a href=#e17d6>Example 17.6 </a>is not elidable, because the “xi” subscript needs something to attach to.
<p>
<a name=s18><h3>Tenses, modals, and logical connection</h3>
<p>
<lx "PU">  XE "PU selma’o"   The tense and modal systems of Lojban interact with the logical connective system. No one chapter can explain all of these simultaneously, so each chapter must present its own view of the area of interaction with emphasis on its own concepts and terminology. In the examples of this chapter, the many tenses of various selma'o as well as the modals of selma'o BAI are represented by the simple time cmavo “pu”, “ca”, and “ba” (of selma'o PU) representing the past, the present, and the future respectively. Preceding a selbri, these cmavo state the time when the bridi was, is, or will be true (analogous to English verb tenses); preceding a sumti, they state that the event of the main bridi is before, simultaneous with, or after the event given by the sumti (which is generally a “le nu” abstraction; see <a href=chap11.html>Chapter 11</a>).
<p>
<cx "logical connection, interaction with tenses">  XE "logical connection: interaction with tenses"   <cx "logically connected tenses, definition">  XE "logically connected tenses: definition"   The two types of interaction between tenses and logical connectives are logically connected tenses and tensed logical connections. The former are fairly simple. Jeks may be used between tense cmavo to specify two connected bridi that differ only in tense:
<p>
<ex "once and future king">  XE "once and future king: example“  <pre><a name=e18d1>18.1)	la .artr. pu nolraitru
		.ije la .artr. ba nolraitru
	Arthur [past] is-a-noblest-governor.
		And Arthur [future] is-a-noblest-governor.
	Arthur was a king, and Arthur will be a king.
</pre>can be reduced to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e18d2>18.2)	la .artr. pu je ba nolraitru
	Arthur [past] and [future] is-a-noblest-governor.
	Arthur was and will be king.
</pre><a href=#e18d1>Example 18.1 </a>and <a href=#e18d2>Example 18.2 </a>are equivalent in meaning; neither says anything about whether Arthur is king now.
<p>
<cx "non-logically connected tenses">  XE "non-logically connected tenses"   Non-logical connection with joiks is also possible between tenses:
<p>
<ex "breathe">  XE "breathe: example“  <pre><a name=e18d3>18.3)	mi pu bi'o ba vasxu
	I [past] from <dots>…</dots>to [future] breathe.
	I breathe from a past time until a future time.
</pre><p>The full tense system makes more interesting tense intervals expressible, such as “from a medium time ago until a long time from now”.
<p>
<cx "forethought connection, in tenses">  XE "forethought connection: in tenses"   <cx "tenses, forethought connection in">  XE “tense: forethought connection in"   <cx "grouping, of connection in tenses">  XE "grouping: of connection in tenses"   <cx "tenses, grouping of connectives in">  XE “tense: grouping of connectives in"   No forethought connections between tenses are permitted by the grammar, nor is there any way to override the default left-grouping rule; these limitations are imposed to keep the tense grammar simpler. Whatever can be said with tenses or modals can be said with subordinate bridi stating the time, place, or mode explicitly, so it is reasonable to try to remove at least some complications.
<p>
<cx "tensed logical connection">  XE "tensed logical connection"   Tensed logical connections are both more complex and more important than logical connections between tenses. Consider the English sentence:
<p>
<ex "went and bought">  XE "went and bought: example“  <pre><a name=e18d4>18.4)	I went to the market, and I bought food.
</pre><p>The verbatim translation of <a href=#e18d4>Example 18.4</a>, namely:
<p>
<pre><a name=e18d5>18.5)	mi pu klama le zarci .ije mi pu tervecnu lo cidja
	I [past] go-to the market. And I [past] buy items-of food.
</pre>fails to fully represent a feature of the English, namely that the buying came after the going. (It also fails to represent that the buying was a consequence of the going, which can be expressed by a modal that is discussed in <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>.) However, the tense information — that the event of my going to the market preceded the event of my buying food — can be added to the logical connective as follows. The “.ije” is replaced by “.ijebo”, and the tense cmavo “ba” is inserted between “.ije” and “bo”:
<p>
<lx ".ijebabo">  XE "ijebabo"   <lx "ba">  XE "ba"   <pre><a name=e18d6>18.6)	mi pu klama le zarci  .ijebabo mi pu tervecnu lo cidja
	I [past] go-to the market.  And [later] I [past] buy items-of food.
</pre><p>Here the “pu” cmavo in the two bridi-tails express the time of both actions with respect to the speaker: in the past. The “ba” relates the two items to one another: the second item is later than the first item. The grammar does not permit omitting the “bo”; if it were omitted, the “ba” and the second “pu” would run together to form a compound tense “bapu” applying to the second bridi-tail only.

Forethought connectives, however (except as noted below) are unable to do so, as are termsets or tense connectives. Mathematical operands and operators can also include tense information in their logical connectives as a result of their close parallelism with sumti and tanru components respectively:

<h2>Chapter 15
<br>
“No” Problems: On Lojban Negation</h2>
<h6>$Revision: 4.0 $<br>
mkhtml: 1.1</h6></p></center>
<p>
<a name=s1><h3>Introductory</h3>
<p>
The grammatical expression of negation is a critical part of Lojban's claim to being logical. The problem of negation, simply put, is to come up with a complete definition of the word “not”. For Lojban's unambiguous grammar, this means further that meanings of “not” with different grammatical effect must be different words, and even different grammatical structures.
<p>
Logical assertions are implicitly required in a logical language; thus, an apparatus for expressing them is built into Lojban's logical connectives and other structures.
<p>
In natural languages, especially those of Indo-European grammar, we have sentences composed of two parts which are typically called “subject” and “predicate”. In the statement
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	John goes to the store
</pre>“John” is the subject, and “goes to the store” is the predicate. Negating <a href=#e1d1>Example 1.1 </a>to produce
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d2>1.2)	John doesn't go to the store.
</pre>has the effect of declaring that the predicate does not hold for the subject. <a href=#e1d2>Example 1.2 </a>says nothing about whether John goes somewhere else, or whether someone else besides John goes to the store.
<p>
We will call this kind of negation “natural language negation”. This kind of negation is difficult to manipulate by the tools of logic, because it doesn't always follow the rules of logic. Logical negation is bi-polar: either a statement is true, or it is false. If a statement is false, then its negation must be true. Such negation is termed contradictory negation.
<p>
Let's look at some examples of how natural language negation can violate the rules of contradictory negation.
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d3>1.3)	Some animals are not white.
<a name=e1d4>1.4)	Some animals are white.
 </pre><p>Both of these statements are true; yet one is apparently the negation of the other. Another example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d5>1.5)	I mustn't go to the dance.
<a name=e1d6>1.6)	I must go to the dance.
</pre><p>At first thought, <a href=#e1d5>Example 1.5 </a>negates <a href=#e1d6>Example 1.6</a>. Thinking further, we realize that there is an intermediate state wherein I am permitted to go to the dance, but not obligated to do so. Thus, it is possible that both statements are false.

<p>
Sometimes order is significant:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d7>1.7)	The falling rock didn't kill Sam.
<a name=e1d8>1.8)	Sam wasn't killed by the falling rock.
</pre><p>Our minds play tricks on us with this one. Because <a href=#e1d7>Example 1.7 </a>is written in what is called the “active voice”, we immediately get confused about whether “the falling rock” is a suitable subject for the predicate “did kill Sam”. “Kill” implies volition to us, and rocks do not have volition. This confusion is employed by opponents of gun control who use the argument “Guns don't kill people; people kill people.”
<p>
Somehow, we don't have the same problem with <a href=#e1d8>Example 1.8</a>. The subject is Sam, and we determine the truth or falsity of the statement by whether he was or wasn't killed by the falling rock.
<p>
<a href=#e1d8>Example 1.8 </a>also helps us focus on the fact that there are at least two questionable facts implicit in this sentence: whether Sam was killed, and if so, whether the falling rock killed him. If Sam wasn't killed, the question of what killed him is moot.
<p>
This type of problem becomes more evident when the subject of the sentence turns out not to exist:
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d9>1.9)	The King of Mexico didn't come to dinner.
<a name=e1d10>1.10)	The King of Mexico did come to dinner.
</pre><p>In the natural languages, we would be inclined to say that both of these statements are false, since there is no King of Mexico.
<p>
The rest of this chapter is designed to explain the Lojban model of negation.
<p>
<a name=s2><h3>bridi negation</h3>
<p>
In discussing Lojban negation, we will call the form of logical negation that simply denies the truth of a statement “bridi negation”. Using bridi negation, we can say the equivalent of “I haven't stopped beating my wife” without implying that I ever started, nor even that I have a wife, meaning simply “It isn't true that I have stopped beating my wife.” Since Lojban uses bridi as smaller components of complex sentences, bridi negation is permitted in these components as well at the sentence level.
<p>
For the bridi negation of a sentence to be true, the sentence being negated must be false. A major use of bridi negation is in making a negative response to a yes/no question; such responses are usually contradictory, denying the truth of the entire sentence. A negative answer to
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	Did you go to the store?
</pre>is taken as a negation of the entire sentence, equivalent to
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d2>2.2)	No, I didn't go to the store.
</pre><p>The most important rule about bridi negation is that if a bridi is true, its negation is false, and vice versa.
<p>
The simplest way to express a bridi negation is to use the cmavo “na” of selma'o NA before the selbri of the affirmative form of the bridi (but after the “cu”, if there is one):
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d3>2.3)	mi klama le zarci
	I go-to the store.
</pre>when negated becomes:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d4>2.4)	mi na klama le zarci
	I [false] go-to the store.
</pre><p>Note that we have used a special convention to show in the English that a bridi negation is present. We would like to use the word “not”, because this highlights the naturalness of putting the negation marker just before the selbri, and makes the form easier to learn. But there is a major difference between Lojban's bridi negation with “na” and natural language negation with “not”. In English, the word “not” can apply to a single word, to a phrase, to an English predicate, or to the entire sentence. In addition, “not” may indicate either contradictory negation or another form of negation, depending on the sentence. Lojban's internal bridi negation, on the other hand, always applies to an entire bridi, and is always a contradictory negation; that is, it contradicts the claim of the whole bridi.
<p>
Because of the ambiguity of English “not”, we will use “[false]” in the translation of Lojban examples to remind the reader that we are expressing a contradictory negation. Here are more examples of bridi negation:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d5>2.5)	mi [cu] na ca klama le zarci
	I [false] now am-a-go-er to the market.
	I am not going to the market now.
<a name=e2d6>2.6)	lo ca nolraitru be le fasygu'e 
cu na krecau
	The-actual present noblest-governor of the French country 
[false] is-hair-without.
	The current king of France isn't bald.
<a name=e2d7>2.7)	ti na barda prenu co melbi mi
	This [false] is a big-person of-type (beautiful to me).
	This isn't a big person who is beautiful to me.
</pre><p>Although there is this fundamental difference between Lojban's internal bridi negation and English negation, we note that in many cases, especially when there are no existential or quantified variables (the cmavo “da”, “de”, and “di” of selma'o KOhA, explained in <a href=chap16.html>Chapter 16</a>) in the bridi, you can indeed translate Lojban “na” as “not” (or “isn't” or “doesn't”, as appropriate).
<p>
The most important rule about bridi negation is that if a bridi is true, its negation is false, and vice versa.
<p>
In Lojban, there are several structures that implicitly contain bridi, so that Lojban sentences may contain more than one occurrence of “na”. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d8>2.8)	mi na gleki le nu
		na klama le nu dansu
	I [false] am-happy-about the event-of
([false] going-to the event-of dancing).
	It is not the case that I am happy about it not being
		the case that I am going to the dance.
	I am not happy about not going to the dance.
In the previous example, we used internal negations in abstraction bridi; bridi negation may also be found in descriptions within sumti. For example:
<a name=e2d9>2.9)	mi nelci le na melbi
	I am fond of the-one-described-as ([false] beautiful)
	I am fond of the one who isn't beautiful.
</pre><p>A more extreme (and more indefinite) example is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d10>2.10)	mi nelci lo na ca nolraitru be le frasygu'e
	I am-fond-of one-who-is ([false] the current king of the French-country).
	I am fond of one who isn't the current king of France.
</pre><p>The claim of <a href=#e2d10>Example 2.10 </a>could apply to anyone except a person who is fond of no one at all, since the relation within the description is false for everyone. You cannot readily express these situations in colloquial English.
<p>
Negation with “na” applies to an entire bridi, and not to just part of a selbri. Therefore, you won't likely have reason to put “na” inside a tanru. In fact, the grammar currently does not allow you to do so (except in a lujvo and in elaborate constructs involving GUhA, the forethought connector for selbri). Any situation where you might want to do so can be expressed in a less-compressed non-tanru form. This grammatical restriction helps ensure that bridi negation is kept separate from other forms of negation.
<p>
The grammar of “na” allows multiple adjacent negations, which cancel out, as in normal logic:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d11>2.11)	ti na na barda prenu co melbi mi
	This [false] [false] is-a-big person that is (beautiful to me).
</pre>which is the same as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d12>2.12)	ti barda prenu co melbi mi
	This is a big-person that is (beautiful to me).
</pre><p>When a selbri is tagged with a tense or a modal, negation with “na” is permitted in two positions: before or after the tag. No semantic difference between these forms has yet been defined, but this is not finally determined, since the interactions between tenses/modals and bridi negation have not been fully explored. In particular, it remains to be seen whether sentences using less familiar tenses, such as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d13>2.13)	mi [cu] ta'e klama le zarci
	I habitually go to the market.
</pre>mean the same thing with “na” before the “ta'e”, as when the negation occurs afterwards; we'll let future, Lojban-speaking, logicians decide on how they relate to each other.
<p>
A final caution on translating English negations into Lojban: if you translate the English literally, you'll get the wrong one. With English causal statements, and other statements with auxiliary clauses, this problem is more likely.
<p>
Thus, if you translate the English:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d14>2.14)	I do not go to the market because the car is broken.
</pre>as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d15>2.15)	mi na klama le zarci ki'u lenu le karce cu spofu
	I [false] go-to the market because the car is broken.
	It is false that:  “I go to the market because the car is broken.”
</pre>you end up negating too much.
<p>
Such mistranslations result from the ambiguity of English compounded by the messiness of natural language negation. A correct translation of the normal interpretation of <a href=#e2d14>Example 2.14 </a>is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d16>2.16)	lenu mi na klama le zarci cu se krinu
		lenu le karce cu spofu
	The event-of (my [false] going-to the market) is justified by
		the event-of (the car being broken).
	My not going to the market is because the car is broken.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e2d16>Example 2.16</a>, the negation is clearly confined to the event abstraction in the x1 sumti, and does not extend to the whole sentence. The English could also have been expressed by two separate sentences joined by a causal connective (which we'll not go into here).
<p>
The problem is not confined to obvious causals. In the English:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d17>2.17)	I was not conscripted into the Army with the help of my uncle the Senator.
</pre>we do not intend the uncle's help to be part of the negation. We must thus move the negation into an event clause or use two separate sentences. The event-clause version would look like:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d18>2.18)	The event-of (my [false] being-conscripted-into the Army) was aided by my uncle the Senator.
</pre><p>It is possible that someone will want to incorporate bridi negations into lujvo. For this reason, the rafsi “-nar-” has been reserved for “na”. However, before using this rafsi, make sure that you intend the contradictory bridi negation, and not the scalar negation described in <a href=#s3>Section 3</a>, which will be much more common in tanru and lujvo.
<p>
<a name=s3><h3>Scalar negation</h3>
<p>
Let us now consider some other types of negation. For example, when we say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d1>3.1)	The chair is not brown.
</pre>we make a positive inference — that the chair is some other color. Thus, it is legitimate to respond:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d2>3.2)	It is green.
</pre><p>Whether we agree that the chair is brown or not, the fact that the statement refers to color has significant effect on how we interpret some responses. If we hear the following exchange:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d3>3.3)	The chair is not brown.
	Correct. The chair is wooden.
</pre>we immediately start to wonder about the unusual wood that isn't brown. If we hear the exchange:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d4>3.4)	Is the chair green?
	No, it is in the kitchen.
</pre>we are unsettled because the response seems to be a non-sequitur. But since it might be true and it is a statement about the chair, one can't say it is entirely irrelevant!
<p>
What is going on in these statements is something called “scalar negation”. As the name suggests, scalar negation presumes an implied scale. A negation of this type not only states that one scalar value is false, but implies that another value on the scale must be true. This can easily lead to complications. The following exchange seems reasonably natural (a little suspension of disbelief in such inane conversation will help):
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d5>3.5)	That isn't a blue house.
	Right!  That is a green house.
</pre><p>We have acknowledged a scalar negation by providing a correct value which is another color in the set of colors permissible for houses. While a little less likely, the following exchange is also natural:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d6>3.6)	That isn't a blue house.
	Right!  That is a blue car.
</pre><p>Again, we have acknowledged a scalar negation, and substituted a different object in the universe of discourse of things that can be blue.
<p>
Now, if the following exchange occurs:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d7>3.7)	That isn't a blue house.
	Right!  That is a green car.
</pre>we find the result unsettling. This is because it seems that two corrections have been applied when there is only one negation. Yet out of context, “blue house” and “green car” seem to be reasonably equivalent units that should be mutually replaceable in a sentence. It's just that we don't have a clear way in English to say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d8>3.8)	That isn't a “blue-house”.
</pre>aloud so as to clearly imply that the scalar negation is affecting the pair of words as a single unit.
<p>
Another even more confusing example of scalar negation is to the sentence:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d9>3.9)	John didn't go to Paris from Rome.
</pre><p>Might <a href=#e3d9>Example 3.9 </a>imply that John went to Paris from somewhere else? Or did he go somewhere else from Rome? Or perhaps he didn't go anywhere at all: maybe someone else did, or maybe there was no event of going whatsoever. One can devise circumstances where any one, two or all three of these statements might be inferred by a listener.
<p>
In English, we have a clear way of distinguishing scalar negation from predicate negation that can be used in many situations. We can use the partial word “non-” as a prefix. But this is not always considered good usage, even though it would render many statements much clearer. For example, we can clearly distinguish
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d10>3.10)	That is a non-blue house.
</pre>from the related sentence
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d11>3.11)	That is a blue non-house.
</pre><a href=#e3d10>Example 3.10 </a>and <a href=#e3d11>Example 3.11 </a>have the advantage that, while they contain a negative indication, they are in fact positive assertions. They say what is true by excluding the false; they do not say what is false.
<p>
We can't always use “non-” though, because of the peculiarities of English's grammar. It would sound strange to say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d12>3.12)	John went to non-Paris from Rome.
</pre>or
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d13>3.13)	John went to Paris from non-Rome.
</pre>although these would clarify the vague negation. Another circumlocution for English scalar negation is “other than”, which works where “non-” does not, but is wordier.
<p>
Finally, we have natural language negations that are called polar negations, or opposites:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d14>3.14)	John is moral
<a name=e3d15>3.15)	John is immoral
</pre><p>To be immoral is much more than to just be not moral: it implies the opposite condition. Statements like <a href=#e3d15>Example 3.15 </a>are strong negations which not only deny the truth of a statement, but assert its opposite. Since, “opposite” implies a scale, polar negations are a special variety of scalar negations.
<p>
To examine this concept more closely, let us draw a linear scale, showing two examples of how the scale is used:
Affirmations	(positive)
Negations	(negative)











All	Most	Some	Few	None
Excellent	Good	Fair	Poor	Awful
<p>
</pre><p>Some scales are more binary than the examples we diagrammed. Thus we have “not necessary” or “unnecessary” being the polar opposite of necessary. Another scale, especially relevant to Lojban, is interpreted based on situations modified by one's philosophy: “not true” may be equated with “false” in a bi-valued truth-functional logic, while in tri-valued logic an intermediate between “true” and “false” is permitted, and in fuzzy logic a continuous scale exists from true to false. The meaning of “not true” requires a knowledge of which variety of truth scale is being considered.
<p>
We will define the most general form of scalar negation as indicating only that the particular point or value in the scale or range is not valid and that some other (unspecified) point on the scale is correct. This is the intent expressed in most contexts by “not mild”, for example.
<p>
Using this paradigm, contradictory negation is less restrictive than scalar negation — it says that the point or value stated is incorrect (false), and makes no statement about the truth of any other point or value, whether or not on the scale.
<p>
In English, scalar negation semantically includes phrases such as “other than”, “reverse of”, or “opposite from” expressions and their equivalents. More commonly, scalar negation is expressed in English by the prefixes “non-”, “un-”, “il-”, and “im-”. Just which form and permissible values are implied by a scalar negation is dependent on the semantics of the word or concept which is being negated, and on the context. Much confusion in English results from the uncontrolled variations in meaning of these phrases and prefixes.
<p>
In the examples of <a href=#s4>Section 4</a>, we will translate the general case of scalar negation using the general formula “other than” when a phrase is scalar-negated, and “non-” when a single word is scalar-negated.
<p>
<a name=s4><h3>selbri and tanru negation</h3>
<p>
All the scalar negations illustrated in <a href=#s3>Section 3 </a>are expressed in Lojban using the cmavo “na'e” (of selma'o NAhE). The most common use of “na'e” is as a prefix to the selbri:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d1>4.1)	mi klama le zarci
	I go to the market.
<a name=e4d2>4.2)	mi na'e klama le zarci
	I non-go to the market.
</pre><p>Comparing these two, we see that the negation operator being used in <a href=#e4d2>Example 4.2 </a>is “na'e”. But what exactly does “na'e” negate? Does the negation include only the gismu “klama”, which is the entire selbri in this case, or does it include the “le zarci” as well? In Lojban, the answer is unambiguously “only the gismu”. The cmavo “na'e” always applies only to what follows it.
<p>
<a href=#e4d2>Example 4.2 </a>looks as if it were parallel to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d3>4.3)	mi na klama le zarci
	I [false] go-to the market.
</pre>but in fact there is no real parallelism at all. A negation using “na” denies the truth of a relationship, but a selbri negation with “na'e” asserts that a relationship exists other than that stated, one which specifically involves the sumti identified in the statement. The grammar allotted to “na'e” allows us to unambiguously express scalar negations in terms of scope, scale, and range within the scale. Before we explain the scalar aspects, let us show how the scope of “na'e” is determined.
<p>
In tanru, we may wish to negate an individual element before combining it with another to form the tanru. We in effect need a shorter-than-selbri-scope negation, for which we can use “na'e” as well. The positive sentence
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d4>4.4)	mi cadzu klama le zarci
	I walking-ly go to the market.
</pre>can be subjected to selbri negation in several ways. Two are:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d5>4.5)	mi na'e cadzu klama le zarci
	I (other-than-walkingly)-go-to the market.
<a name=e4d6>4.6)	mi cadzu na'e klama le zarci
	I walkingly-(other-than-go-to) the market.
</pre><p>These negations show the default scope of “na'e” is close-binding on an individual brivla in a tanru. <a href=#e4d5>Example 4.5 </a>says that I am going to the market, but in some kind of a non-walking manner. (As with most tanru, there are a few other possible interpretations, but we'll assume this one — see <a href=chap5.html>Chapter 5 </a>for a discussion of tanru meaning).
<p>
In neither <a href=#e4d5>Example 4.5 </a>nor <a href=#e4d6>Example 4.6 </a>does the “na'e” negate the entire selbri. While both sentences contain negations that deny a particular relationship between the sumti, they also have a component which makes a positive claim about such a relationship. This is clearer in <a href=#e4d5>Example 4.5</a>, which says that I am going, but in a non-walking manner. In <a href=#e4d6>Example 4.6</a>, we have claimed that the relationship between me and the market in some way involves walking, but is not one of “going to” (perhaps we are walking around the market, or walking-in-place while at the market).
<p>
The “scale”, or actually the “set”, implied in Lojban tanru negations is anything which plausibly can be substituted into the tanru. (Plausibility here is interpreted in the same way that answers to a “mo” question must be plausible — the result must not only have the right number of places and have sumti values appropriate to the place structure, it must also be appropriate or relevant to the context.) This minimal condition allows a speaker to be intentionally vague, while still communicating meaningful information. The speaker who uses selbri negation is denying one relationship, while minimally asserting a different relationship.
<p>
We also need a scalar negation form that has a scope longer than a single brivla. There exists such a longer-scope selbri negation form, as exemplified by (each Lojban sentence in the next several examples is given twice, with parentheses in the second copy showing the scope of the “na'e”):
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d7>4.7)	mi na'eke cadzu klama [ke'e] le zarci
	mi na'e (ke cadzu klama [ke'e]) le zarci
	I other-than-(walkingly-go-to) the market.
</pre><p>This negation uses the same “ke” and “ke'e” delimiters (the “ke'e” is always elidable at the end of a selbri) that are used in tanru. The sentence clearly negates the entire selbri. The “ke'e”, whether elided or not, reminds us that the negation does not include the trailing sumti. While the trailing-sumti place-structure is defined as that of the final brivla, the trailing sumti themselves are not part of the selbri and are thus not negated by “na'e”.
<p>
Negations of just part of the selbri are also permitted:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d8>4.8)	mi na'eke sutra cadzu ke'e klama le zarci
	mi na'e (ke sutra cadzu ke'e) klama le zarci
	I other-than-(quickly-walkingly) go-to the market.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e4d8>Example 4.8</a>, only the “sutra cadzu” tanru is negated, so the speaker is indeed going to the market, but not by walking quickly.
<p>
Negations made with “na'e” or “na'eke” also include within their scope any sumti attached to the brivla or tanru with “be” or “bei”. Such attached sumti are considered part of the brivla or tanru:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d9>4.9)	mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be le mi birka ke'e klama le zarci
	I other-than-(quickly walking-on-my-arms-ly) go-to the market.
</pre><p>Note that <a href=#e4d10>Example 4.10 </a>and <a href=#e4d11>Example 4.11 </a>do not express the same thing:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d10>4.10)	mi na'eke sutra cadzu [ke'e] lemi birka
	mi na'e (ke sutra cadzu [ke'e]) lemi birka
	I other-than-(quickly-walk-on) my-arms.
<a name=e4d11>4.11)	mi na'eke sutra cadzu be lemi birka [ke'e]
	mi na'e (ke sutra cadzu be lemi birka [ke'e])
	I other-than-(quickly-walk-on my-arms).
</pre><p>The translations show that the negation in <a href=#e4d10>Example 4.10 </a>is more restricted in scope; i.e. less of the sentence is negated with respect to x1 (“mi”).
<p>
Logical scope being an important factor in Lojban's claims to be unambiguous, let us indicate the relative precedence of “na'e” as an operator. Grouping with “ke” and “ke'e”, of course, has an overt scope, which is its advantage. “na'e” is very close binding to its brivla. Internal binding of tanru, with “bo”, is not as tightly bound as “na'e”. “co”, the tanru inversion operator has a scope that is longer than all other tanru constructs.
<p>
In short, “na'e” and “na'eke” define a type of negation, which is shorter in scope than bridi negation, and which affects all or part of a selbri. The result of “na'e” negation remains an assertion of some specific truth and not merely a denial of another claim.
<p>
The similarity becomes striking when it is noticed that the rafsi “-nal-”, representing “na'e” when a tanru is condensed into a lujvo, forms an exact parallel to the English usage of “non-”. Turning a series of related negations into lujvo gives:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d12>4.12)	na'e klama becomes nalkla
	na'e cadzu klama becomes naldzukla
	na'e sutra cadzu klama becomes nalsu'adzukla
	nake sutra cadzu ke'e klama becomes nalsu'adzuke'ekla
</pre><p>Note: “-kem-” is the rafsi for “ke”, but it is omitted in the final lujvo as superfluous — “ke'e” is its own rafsi, and its inclusion in the lujvo implies a “ke” after the “-nal-”, since it needs to close something; only a “ke” immediately after the negation would make the “ke'e” meaningful in the tanru expressed in this lujvo.
<p>
In a lujvo, it is probably clearest to translate “-nal-” as “non-”, to match the English combining forms, except when the “na'e” has single word scope and English uses “un-” or “im-” to negate that single word. Translation style should determine the use of “other than”, “non-”, or another negator for “na'e” in tanru; the translator must render the Lojban into English so it is clear in context. Let's go back to our simplest example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d13>4.13)	mi na'e klama le zarci
	I am other-than-(going-to) the market.
	?I am not going-to the market.
<a name=e4d14>4.14)	mi nalkla le zarci
	I am-a-non-go-er-to the market.
</pre><p>Note that to compare with the English translation form using “non-”, we've translated the Lojban as if the selbri were a noun. Since Lojban “klama” is indifferently a noun, verb, or adjective, the difference is purely a translation change, not a true change in meaning. The English difference seems significant, though, due to the strongly different English grammatical forms and the ambiguity of English negation.
<p>
Consider the following highly problematic sentence:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d15>4.15)	lo ca nolraitru be le fasygu'e cu krecau
	An-actual currently noblest-governor of the French country 	is-hair-without.
	The current King of France is bald.
</pre><p>The selbri “krecau” negates with “na'e” as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d16>4.16)	lo ca nolraitru be le fasygu'e
		cu na'e krecau
	An-actual currently noblest-governor of the French country
		is-other-than hair-without.
	The current King of France is other-than-bald.

</pre>or, as a lujvo:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d17>4.17)	lo ca nolraitru be le fasygu'e
		cu nalkrecau
	An-actual currently noblest-governor of the French country
		is-non-hair-without.
	The current King of France is a non-bald-one.
</pre><a href=#e4d16>Example 4.16 </a>and <a href=#e4d17>Example 4.17 </a>express the predicate negation forms using a negation word (“na'e”) or rafsi (“-nal-”); yet they make positive assertions about the current King of France; ie., that he is other-than-bald or non-bald. This follows from the close binding of “na'e” to the brivla. The lujvo form makes this overt by absorbing the negative marker into the word.
<p>
Since there is no current King of France, it is false to say that he is bald, or non-bald, or to make any other affirmative claim about him. Any sentence about the current King of France containing only a selbri negation is as false as the sentence without the negation. No amount of selbri negations have any effect on the truth value of the sentence, which is invariably “false”, since no affirmative statement about the current King of France can be true. On the other hand, bridi negation does produce a truth:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d18>4.18)	lo ca nolraitru be le fasygu'e
		cu na krecau
	An-actual current noblest-governor of the French Country 
		[false] is-hair-without.
	It is false that the current King of France is bald.
</pre><p>Note: “lo” is used in these sentences because negation relates to truth conditions. To meaningfully talk about truth conditions in sentences carrying a description, it must be clear that the description actually applies to the referent. A sentence using “le” instead of “lo” can be true even if there is no current king of France, as long as the speaker and the listener agree to describe something as the current king of France. (See the explanations of “le” in <a href=chap6.html>Chapter 6</a>.)
<p>
<a name=s5><h3>Expressing scales in selbri negation</h3>
<p>
In expressing a scalar negation, we can provide some indication of the scale, range, frame-of-reference, or universe of discourse that is being dealt with in an assertion. As stated in <a href=#s4>Section 4</a>, the default is the set of plausible alternatives. Thus if we say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	le stizu cu na'e xunre
	The chair is a non-(red-thing).
</pre>the pragmatic interpretation is that we mean a different color and not
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d2>5.2)	le stizu cu dzukla be le zarci
	The chair walkingly-goes-to-the-market.
</pre><p>However, if we have reason to be more explicit (an obtuse or contrary listener, or simply an overt logical analysis), we can clarify that we are referring to a color by saying:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d3>5.3)	le stizu cu na'e xunre skari
	The chair is of a non-(red)-color (as perceived by something under
some conditions).
</pre><p>We might also have reduced the pragmatic ambiguity by making the two trailing sumti values explicit (the “as perceived by” and “under conditions” places have been added to the place structure of “xunre”). But assume we have a really stubborn listener (an artificially semi-intelligent computer?) who will find a way to misinterpret <a href=#e5d3>Example 5.3 </a>even with three specific sumti provided.
<p>
In this case, we use a sumti tagged with the sumti tcita “ci'u”, which translates roughly as “on a scale of X”, where “X” is the sumti. For maximal clarity, the tagged sumti can be bound into the negated selbri with “be”. To clarify <a href=#e5d3>Example 5.3</a>, we might say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d4>5.4)	le stizu cu na'e xunre be ci'u loka skari
	The chair is a non-(red on-a-scale-of-colorness)-thing.
</pre><p>We can alternately use the sumti tcita “teci'e”, based on “ciste”, which translates roughly as “of a system of components X”, for universes of discourse; in this case, we would express <a href=#e5d3>Example 5.3 </a>as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d5>5.5)	le stizu cu na'e xunre be teci'e le skari
	The chair is a non-(red of-a-system-with-components-the-colors)-thing.
</pre><p>Other places of “ciste” can be brought out using the grammar of selma'o BAI modals, allowing slightly different forms of expression, thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d6>5.6)	le stizu cu na'e xunre be ci'e lo'i skari
	The chair is a non-(red of-a-system-which-is-the-set-of-colors)-thing.
</pre><p>The cmavo “le'a”, also in selma'o BAI, can be used to specify a category:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d7>5.7)	le stizu cu na'e xunre be le'a lo'i skari
	The chair is a non-(red of-a-category-which-is-the-set-of-colors)-thing.
</pre>which is minimally different in meaning from <a href=#e5d6>Example 5.6</a>.
<p>
The cmavo “na'e” is not the only member of selma'o NAhE. If we want to express a scalar negation which is a polar opposite, we use the cmavo “to'e”, which is grammatically equivalent to “na'e”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d8>5.8)	le stizu cu to'e xunre be ci'u loka skari
	The chair is a ( opposite-of red ) on-scale a-property-of color-ness.
</pre><p>Likewise, the midpoint of a scale can be expressed with the cmavo “no'e”, also grammatically equivalent to “na'e”. Here are some parallel examples of “na'e”, “no'e”, and “to'e”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d9>5.9)	ta melbi
	That is-beautiful.
<a name=e5d10>5.10)	ta na'e melbi
	That is-non-beautiful.
	That is other than beautiful.
	That is ugly [in one sense].
<a name=e5d11>5.11)	ta no'e melbi
	That is-neutrally beautiful.
	That is plain/ordinary-looking (neither ugly nor beautiful).

<a name=e5d12>5.12)	ta to'e melbi
	That is-opposite-of beautiful.
	That is ugly/very ugly/repulsive.
</pre><p>The cmavo “to'e” has the assigned rafsi “-tol-” and “-to'e-”; the cmavo “no'e” has the assigned rafsi “-nor-” and “-no'e-”. The selbri in <a href=#e5d10>Example 5.10 </a>through <a href=#e5d12>Example 5.12 </a>could be replaced by the lujvo “nalmle”, “normle”, and “tolmle” respectively.
<p>
This large variety of scalar negations is provided because different scales have different properties. Some scales are open-ended in both directions: there is no “ultimately ugly” or “ultimately beautiful”. Other scales, like temperature, are open at one end and closed at the other: there is a minimum temperature (so-called “absolute zero”) but no maximum temperature. Still other scales are closed at both ends.
<p>
Correspondingly, some selbri have no obvious “to'e” — what is the opposite of a dog? — while others have more than one, and need “ci'u” to specify which opposite is meant.
<p>
<a name=s6><h3>sumti negation</h3>
<p>
There are two ways of negating sumti in Lojban. We have the choice of quantifying the sumti with zero, or of applying the sumti-negator “na'ebo” before the sumti. It turns out that a zero quantification serves for contradictory negation. As the cmavo we use implies, “na'ebo” forms a scalar negation.
<p>
Let us show examples of each.
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d1>6.1)	no lo ca nolraitru be le fasygu'e
		cu krecau
	Zero of those who are currently noblest-governors of the French country 
are-hair-without.
	No current king of France is bald.
</pre><p>Is <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1 </a>true? Yes, because it merely claims that of the current Kings of France, however many there may be, none are bald, which is plainly true, since there are no such current Kings of France.
<p>
Now let us look at the same sentence using “na'ebo” negation:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d2>6.2)	na'ebo lo ca nolraitru
		be le fasygu'e cu krecau
	[Something] other-than-(the-current-noblest-governor
		of the French country) is-hair-without.
	Something other than the current King of France is bald.
</pre><a href=#e6d2>Example 6.2 </a>is true provided that something reasonably describable as “other than a current King of France”, such as the King of Saudi Arabia, or a former King of France, is in fact bald.
<p>
In place of “na'ebo”, you may also use “no'ebo” and “to'ebo”, to be more specific about the sumti which would be appropriate in place of the stated sumti. Good examples are hard to come by, but here's a valiant try:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d3>6.3)	mi klama to'ebo la bastn.
	I go to the-opposite-of Boston.
	I go to Perth.
</pre>(Boston and Perth are nearly, but not quite, antipodal cities. In a purely United States context, San Francisco might be a better “opposite”.) Coming up with good examples is difficult, because attaching “to'ebo” to a description sumti is usually the same as attaching “to'e” to the selbri of the description.
<p>
It is not possible to transform sumti negations of either type into bridi negations or scalar selbri negations. Negations of sumti will be used in Lojban conversation. The inability to manipulate these negations logically will, it is hoped, prevent the logical errors that result when natural languages attempt corresponding manipulations.
<p>
<a name=s7><h3>Negation of minor grammatical constructs</h3>
<p>
We have a few other constructs that can be negated, all of them based on negating individual words. For such negation, we use the suffix-combining negator, which is “nai”. “nai”, by the way, is almost always written as a compound into the previous word that it is negating, although it is a regular separate-word cmavo and the sole member of selma'o NAI.
<p>
Most of these negation forms are straightforward, and should be discussed and interpreted in connection with an analysis of the particular construct being negated. Thus, we will not go into much detail here.
<p>
The following are places where “nai” is used:
<p>
When attached to tenses and modals (see <a href=chap10.html>Chapter 10</a>), the “nai” suffix usually indicates a contradictory negation of the tagged bridi. Thus “punai” as a tense inflection means “not-in-the-past”, or “not-previously”, without making any implication about any other time period unless explicitly stated. As a result,
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	mi na pu klama le zarci
	I [false] [past] go-to the store.
	I didn't go to the store.
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d2>7.2)	mi punai klama le zarci
	I [past-not] go-to the store.
	I didn't go to the store.
</pre>mean exactly the same thing, although there may be a difference of emphasis.
<p>
Tenses and modals can be logically connected, with the logical connectives containing contradictory negations; this allows negated tenses and modals to be expressed positively using logical connectives. Thus “punai je ca” means the same thing as “pu naje ca”.
<p>
As a special case, a “-nai” attached to the interval modifiers of selma'o TAhE, ROI, or ZAhO (explained in <a href=chap10.html>Chapter 10</a>) signals a scalar negation:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d3>7.3)	mi paroinai dansu le bisli
	I [once] [not] dance-on the ice
</pre>means that I dance on the ice either zero or else two or more times within the relevant time interval described by the bridi. <a href=#e7d3>Example 7.3 </a>is very different from the English use of “not once”, which is an emphatic way of saying “never” — that is, exactly zero times.
<p>
In indicators and attitudinals of selma'o UI or CAI, “nai” denotes a polar negation. As discussed in <a href=chap13.html>Chapter 13</a>, most indicators have an implicit scale, and “nai” changes the indicator to refer to the opposite end of the scale. Thus “.uinai” expresses unhappiness, and “.ienai” expresses disagreement (not ambivalence, which is expressed with the neutral or undecided intensity as “.iecu'i”).
<p>
Vocative cmavo of selma'o COI are considered a kind of indicator, but one which identifies the listener. Semantically, we could dispense with about half of the COI selma'o words based on the scalar paradigm. For example, “co'o” could be expressed as “coinai”. However, this is not generally done.
<p>
Most of the COI cmavo are used in what are commonly called protocol situations. These protocols are used, for example, in radio conversations, which often take place in a noisy environment. The negatives of protocol words tend to convey diametrically opposite communications situations (as might be expected). Therefore, only one protocol vocative is dependent on “nai”: negative acknowledgement, which is “je'enai” (“I didn't get that”).
<p>
Unlike the attitudinal indicators, which tend to be unimportant in noisy situations, the protocol vocatives become more important. So if, in a noisy environment, a protocol listener makes out only “nai”, he or she can presume it is a negative acknowledgement and repeat transmission or otherwise respond accordingly. <a href=chap13.html>Chapter 13 </a>provides more detail on this topic.
<p>
The abstractors of selma'o NU follow the pattern of the tenses and modals. NU allows negative abstractions, especially in compound abstractions connected by logical connectives: “su'ujeninai”, which corresponds to “su'u jenai ni” just as “punai je ca” corresponds to “pu naje ca”. It is not clear how much use logically connected abstractors will be: see <a href=chap13.html>Chapter 13</a>.
<p>
A “nai” attached to a non-logical connective (of selma'o JOI or BIhI) is a scalar negation, and says that the bridi is false under the specified mixture, but that another connective is applicable. Non-logical connectives are discussed in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>.
<p>
<a name=s8><h3>Truth questions</h3>
<p>
One application of negation is in answer to truth questions (those which expect the answers “Yes” or “No”). The truth question cmavo “xu” is in selma'o UI; placed at the beginning of a sentence, it asks whether the sentence as a whole is true or false.
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d1>8.1)	xu la djan. pu klama la paris. .e la rom.
	Is it true that:  ( John previously went-to [both] Paris and Rome. )
</pre><p>You can now use each of the several kinds of negation we've discussed in answer to this (presuming the same question and context for each answer).
<p>
The straightforward negative answer is grammatically equivalent to the expanded sentence with the “na” immediately after the “cu” (and before any tense/modal):
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d2>8.2)	na go'i
	[false] [repeat previous]
	No.
</pre>which means
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d3>8.3)	la djan. [cu] na pu klama la paris. .e la rom.
	John [false] previously went-to [both] Paris and Rome.
	It's not true that John went to Paris and Rome.
</pre><p>The respondent can change the tense, putting the “na” in either before or after the new tense:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d4>8.4)	na ba go'i
	[false] [future] [repeat previous]
</pre>meaning
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d5>8.5)	la djan. [cu] na ba klama la paris. .e la rom.
	John [false] later-will-go-to [both] Paris and Rome.
	It is false that John will go to Paris and Rome.
</pre>or alternatively
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d6>8.6)	ba na go'i
	[false] [future] [repeat previous]
</pre>meaning
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d7>8.7)	la djan. [cu] ba na klama la paris. .e la rom.
	John later-will [false] go-to [both] Paris and Rome.
</pre><p>We stated in <a href=#s3>Section 3 </a>that sentences like <a href=#e8d5>Example 8.5 </a>and <a href=#e8d7>Example 8.7 </a>appear to be semantically identical, but that subtle semantic distinctions may eventually be found.
<p>
You can also use a scalar negation with “na'e”, in which case, it is equivalent to putting a “na'eke” immediately after any tense:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d8>8.8)	na'e go'i
	other-than [repeat previous]
</pre>which means
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d9>8.9)	la djan. [cu] pu na'eke klama [ke'e] la paris. .e la rom.
	John previously other-than(went-to) [both] Paris and Rome.
</pre><p>He might have telephoned the two cities instead of going there. The unnecessary “ke” and “ke'e” would have been essential if the selbri had been a tanru.
<p>
<a name=s9><h3>Affirmations</h3>
<p>
There is an explicit positive form for both selma'o NA (“ja'a”) and selma'o NAhE (“je'a”), each of which would supplant the corresponding negator in the grammatical position used, allowing one to assert the positive in response to a negative question or statement without confusion. Assuming the same context as in <a href=#s8>Section 8</a>:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	xu na go'i
	Is-it-true-that [false] [repeat previous]?
</pre>or equivalently
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d2>9.2)	xu la djan. [cu] na pu klama la paris. .e la rom.
	Is it true that:  John [false] previously-went-to [both] Paris and Rome.]
</pre><p>The obvious, but incorrect, positive response to this negative question is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d3>9.3)	go'i
	[repeat previous]
</pre><p>A plain “go'i” does not mean “Yes it is”; it merely abbreviates repeating the previous statement unmodified, including any negators present; and <a href=#e9d3>Example 9.3 </a>actually states that it is false that John went to both Paris and Rome.
<p>
When considering:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d4>9.4)	na go'i
	[false] [repeat previous]
</pre>as a response to a negative question like <a href=#e9d2>Example 9.2</a>, Lojban designers had to choose between two equally plausible interpretations with opposite effects. Does <a href=#e9d4>Example 9.4 </a>create a double negative in the sentence by adding a new “na” to the one already there (forming a double negative and hence a positive statement), or does the “na” replace the previous one, leaving the sentence unchanged?
<p>
It was decided that substitution, the latter alternative, is the preferable choice, since it is then clear whether we intend a positive or a negative sentence without performing any manipulations. This is the way English usually works, but not all languages work this way — Russian, Japanese, and Navajo all interpret a negative reply to a negative question as positive.
<p>
The positive assertion cmavo of selma'o NA, which is “ja’a”, can also replace the “na” in the context, giving:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d5>9.5)	ja'a go'i
	(John truly-(previously went-to) [both] Paris and Rome.)
</pre>“ja'a” can replace “na” in a similar manner wherever the latter is used:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d6>9.6)	mi ja’a klama le zarci
	I indeed go to the store.
</pre>“je'a” can replace “na'e” in exactly the same way, stating that scalar negation does not apply, and that the relation indeed holds as stated. In the absence of a negation context, it emphasizes the positive:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d7>9.7)	ta je'a melbi
	that is-indeed beautiful.
</pre><a name=s10><h3>Metalinguistic negation forms</h3>
<p>
The question of truth or falsity is not entirely synonymous with negation. Consider the English sentence
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d1>10.1)	I have not stopped beating my wife.
</pre><p>If I never started such a heinous activity, then this sentence is neither true nor false. Such a negation simply says that something is wrong with the non-negated statement. Generally, we then use either tone of voice or else a correction to express a preferred true claim: “I never have beaten my wife.”
<p>
Negations which follow such a pattern are called “metalinguistic negations”. In natural languages, the mark of metalinguistic negation is that an indication of a correct statement always, or almost always, follows the negation. Tone of voice or emphasis may be further used to clarify the error.
<p>
Negations of every sort must be expressible in Lojban; errors are inherent to human thought, and are not excluded from the language. When such negations are metalinguistic, we must separate them from logical claims about the truth or falsity of the statement, as well as from scalar negations which may not easily express (or imply) the preferred claim. Because Lojban allows concepts to be so freely combined in tanru, limits on what is plausible or not plausible tend to be harder to determine.
<p>
Mimicking the muddled nature of natural language negation would destroy this separation. Since Lojban does not use tone of voice, we need other means to metalinguistically indicate what is wrong with a statement. When the statement is entirely inappropriate, we need to be able to express metalinguistic negation in a more non-specific fashion.
<p>
Here is a list of some different kinds of metalinguistic negation with English-language examples:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d2>10.2)	I have not <i>stopped</i> beating my wife
	(I never started — failure of presupposition).
<a name=e10d3>10.3)	5 is not blue
	(color does not apply to abstract concepts -- failure of category).
<a name=e10d4>10.4)	The current King of France is not bald.
	(there is no current King of France --- existential failure)
<a name=e10d5>10.5)	I do not have THREE children.
	(I have two --- simple undue quantity)
<a name=e10d6>10.6)	I have not held THREE jobs previously, but four.
	(inaccurate quantity; the difference from the previous example is that
someone who has held four jobs has also held three jobs)
<a name=e10d7>10.7)	It is not good, but bad.
	(undue quantity negation indicating that the value on a scale for measuring
the predicate is incorrect)
<a name=e10d8>10.8)	She is not PRETTY; she is beautiful
	(undue quantity transferred to a non-numeric scale)
<a name=e10d9>10.9)	The house is not blue, but green.
	(the scale/category being used is incorrect, but a related category applies)
<a name=e10d10>10.10)	The house is not blue, but is colored.
	(the scale/category being used is incorrect, but a broader category applies)
<a name=e10d11>10.11)	The cat is not blue, but long-haired.
	(the scale/category being used is incorrect, but an unrelated category
applies)
<a name=e10d12>10.12)	A:  He ain't coming today.
	B:  “Ain't” ain't a word.
	(solecism, or improper grammatical action)
<a name=e10d13>10.13)	I haven't STOOPED beating my wife; I've STOPPED.
	(spelling or mispronunciation error)
<a name=e10d14>10.14)	Not only was it a sheep, it was a black sheep.
	(non-contradictory correction)
</pre><p>The set of possible metalinguistic errors is open-ended.
<p>
Many of these forms have a counterpart in the various examples that we've discussed under logical negation. Metalinguistic negation doesn't claim that the sentence is false or true, though. Rather, it claims that, due to some error in the statement, “true” and “false” don't really apply.
<p>
Because one can metalinguistically negate a true statement intending a non-contradictory correction (say, a spelling error); we need a way (or ways) to metalinguistically negate a statement which is independent of our logical negation schemes using “na”, “na'e” and kin. The cmavo “na'i” is assigned this function. If it is present in a statement, it indicates metalinguistically that something in the statement is incorrect. This metalinguistic negation must override any evaluation of the logic of the statement. It is equally allowed in both positive and negative statements.
<p>
Since “na'i” is not a logical operator, multiple occurrences of “na'i” need not be assumed to cancel each other. Indeed, we can use the position of “na'i” to indicate metalinguistically what is incorrect, preparatory to correcting it in a later sentence; for this reason, we give “na'i” the grammar of UI. The inclusion of “na'i” anywhere in a sentence makes it a non-assertion, and suggests one or more pitfalls in assigning a truth value.
<p>
Let us briefly indicate how the above-mentioned metalinguistic errors can be identified. Other metalinguistic problems can then be marked by devising analogies to these examples:
<p>
Existential failure can be marked by attaching “na'i” to the descriptor “lo” or the “poi” in a “da poi”-form sumti. (See Chapter 6 and <a href=chap16.html>Chapter 16 </a>for details on these constructions.) Remember that if a “le” sumti seems to refer to a non-existent referent, you may not understand what the speaker has in mind — the appropriate response is then “ki'a”, asking for clarification.
<p>
Presupposition failure can be marked directly if the presupposition is overt; if not, one can insert a “mock presupposition” to question with the sumti tcita (selma'o BAI) word “ji'u”; “ji'uku” thus explicitly refers to an unexpressed assumption, and “ji'una'iku” metalinguistically says that something is wrong with that assumption. (See <a href=chap10.html>Chapter 10</a>.)
<p>
Scale errors and category errors can be similarly expressed with selma'o BAI. “le'a” has meaning “of category/class/type X”, “ci'u” has meaning “on scale X”, and “ci'e”, based on “ciste”, can be used to talk about universes of discourse defined either as systems or sets of components, as shown in <a href=#s8>Section 8</a>. “kai” and “la'u” also exist in BAI for discussing other quality and quantity errors.
<p>
We have to make particular note of potential problems in the areas of undue quantity and incorrect scale/category. Assertions about the relationships between gismu are among the basic substance of the language. It is thus invalid to logically require that if something is blue, that it is colored, or if it is not-blue, then it is some other color. In Lojban, “blanu” (“blue”) is not explicitly defined as a “skari” (“color”). Similarly, it is not implicit that the opposite of “good” is “bad”.
<p>
This mutual independence of gismu is only an ideal. Pragmatically, people will categorize things based on their world-views. We will write dictionary definitions that will relate gismu, unfortunately including some of these world-view assumptions. Lojbanists should try to minimize these assumptions, but this seems a likely area where logical rules will break down (or where Sapir-Whorf effects will be made evident). In terms of negation, however, it is vital that we clearly preserve the capability of denying a presumably obvious scale or category assumption.
<p>
Solecisms, grammatical and spelling errors will be marked by marking the offending word or phrase with “na'i” (in the manner of any selma'o UI cmavo). In this sense, “na'i” becomes equivalent to the English metalinguistic marker “[sic]”. Purists may choose to use ZOI or LOhU/LEhU quotes or “sa'a”-marked corrections to avoid repeating a truly unparsable passage, especially if a computer is to analyze the speech/text. See <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19 </a>for explanations of these usages.
<p>
In summary, metalinguistic negation will typically take the form of referring to a previous statement and marking it with one or more “na'i” to indicate what metalinguistic errors have been made, and then repeating the statement with corrections. References to previous statements may be full repetitions, or may use members of selma'o GOhA. “na'i” at the beginning of a statement merely says that something is inappropriate about the statement, without specificity.
<p>
In normal use, metalinguistic negation requires that a corrected statement follow the negated statement. In Lojban, however, it is possible to completely and unambiguously specify metalinguistic errors without correcting them. It will eventually be seen whether an uncorrected metalinguistic negation remains an acceptable form in Lojban. In such a statement, metalinguistic expression would involve an ellipsis not unlike that of tenseless expression.
<p>
Note that metalinguistic negation gives us another kind of legitimate negative answer to a “xu” question (see <a href=#s8>Section 8</a>). “na'i” will be used when something about the questioned statement is inappropriate, such as in questions like “Have you stopped beating your wife?”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d15>10.15)	xu do sisti lezu'o do rapydarxi ledo fetspe
	Have you ceased the activity of repeat-hitting your female-spouse?
</pre><p>Responses could include:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d16>10.16)	na'i go'i
	The bridi as a whole is inappropriate in some way.
<a name=e10d17>10.17)	go'i na'i
	The selbri (sisti) is inappropriate in some way.
</pre><p>One can also specifically qualify the metalinguistic negation, by explicitly repeating the erroneous portion of the bridi to be metalinguistically negated, or adding on of the selma'o BAI qualifiers mentioned above:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d18>10.18)	go'i ji'una'iku
	Some presupposition is wrong with the previous bridi.
</pre><p>Finally, one may metalinguistically affirm a bridi with “jo'a”, another cmavo of selma'o UI. A common use for “jo'a” might be to affirm that a particular construction, though unusual or counterintuitive, is in fact correct; another usage would be to disagree with — by overriding — a respondent's metalinguistic negation.

“Who Did You Pass On The Road? Nobody”: Lojban And Logic</h2>
<h6>$Revision: 4.0 $<br>
mkhtml: 1.1</h6></p></center>
<p>
<a name=s1><h3>What's wrong with this picture?</h3>
<p>
<cx "nobody, interpretation of">  XE "nobody: interpretation of"   The following brief dialogue is from <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7 </a>of <cite>Through The Looking Glass </cite>by Lewis Carroll.
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	“Who did you pass on the road?” the King went on, holding out his hand to the Messenger for some more hay.
<a name=e1d2>1.2)	“Nobody,” said the Messenger.
<a name=e1d3>1.3)	“Quite right,” said the King:  “this young lady saw him too. So of course Nobody walks slower than you. ”
<a name=e1d4>1.4)	“I do my best,” the Messenger said in a sulky tone. “I'm sure nobody walks much faster than I do!”
<a name=e1d5>1.5)	“He can't do that,” said the King, “or else he'd have been here first.”
</pre><p>This nonsensical conversation results because the King insists on treating the word “nobody” as a name, a name of somebody. However, the essential nature of the English word “nobody” is that it doesn't refer to somebody; or to put the matter another way, there isn't anybody to which it refers.
<p>
<cx "nobody, ambiguous interpretations of">  XE "nobody: ambiguous interpretations of"   The central point of contradiction in the dialogue arises in <a href=#e1d3>Example 1.3</a>, when the King says “<dots>… </dots>Nobody walks slower than you”. This claim would be plausible if “Nobody” were really a name, since the Messenger could only pass someone who does walk more slowly than he. But the Messenger interprets the word “nobody” in the ordinary English way, and says (in <a href=#e1d4>Example 1.4</a>) “<dots>… </dots>nobody walks much faster than I do” (i.e., I walk faster, or as fast as, almost everyone), which the King then again misunderstands. Both the King and the Messenger are correct according to their respective understandings of the ambiguous word “nobody/Nobody”.
<p>
<cx "nobody, Lojban contrasted with English">  XE "nobody: Lojban contrasted with English"   There are Lojban words or phrases corresponding to the problematic English words “somebody”, “nobody”, “anybody”, “everybody” (and their counterparts “some/no/any/everyone” and “some/no/any/everything”), but they obey rules which can often be surprising to English-speakers. The dialogue above simply cannot be translated into Lojban without distortion: the name “Nobody” would have to be represented by a Lojban name, which would spoil the perfection of the wordplay. As a matter of fact, this is the desired result: a logical language should not allow two conversationalists to affirm “Nobody walks slower than the Messenger” and “Nobody walks faster than the Messenger” and both be telling the truth. (Unless, of course, nobody but the Messenger walks at all, or everyone walks at exactly the same speed.)
<p>
<cx "logic, resolving ambiguities of “nobody”">  XE "logic: resolving ambiguities of \“nobody\”"   This chapter will explore the Lojban mechanisms that allow the correct and consistent construction of sentences like those in the dialogue. There are no new grammatical constructs explained in this chapter; instead, it discusses the way in which existing facilities that allow Lojban-speakers to resolve problems like the above, using the concepts of modern logic. However, we will not approach the matter from the viewpoint of logicians, although readers who know something of logic will discover familiar notions in Lojban guise.
<p>
<cx "logic, limits of">  XE "logic: limits of"   Although Lojban is called a logical language, not every feature of it is “logical”. In particular, the use of “le” is incompatible with logical reasoning based on the description selbri, because that selbri may not truthfully apply: you cannot conclude from my statement that
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d6>1.6)	mi viska le nanmu
	I see the-one-I-refer-to-as-the man.
	I see the man/men.
</pre>that there really is a man; the only thing you can conclude is that there is one thing (or more) that I choose to refer to as a man. You cannot even tell which man is meant for sure without asking me (although communication is served if you already know from the context).
<p>
<cx "logic, and attitudinals">  XE "logic: and attitudinals"   <cx "attitudinals, and logic">  XE "attitudinals: and logic"   In addition, the use of attitudinals (see <a href=chap13.html>Chapter 13</a>) often reduces or removes the ability to make deductions about the bridi to which those attitudinals are applied. From the fact that I hope George will win the election, you can conclude nothing about George's actual victory or defeat.
<p>
<a name=s2><h3>Existential claims, prenexes, and variables</h3>
<p>
Let us consider, to begin with, a sentence that is not in the dialogue:
<p>
<ex "something sees me">  XE "something sees me: example“  <pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	Something sees me.
</pre><p>There are two plausible Lojban translations of <a href=#e2d1>Example 2.1</a>. The simpler one is:
<p>
<lx "zo'e">  XE "zo'e"   <pre><a name=e2d2>2.2)	[zo'e] viska mi
	Something-unspecified sees me.
</pre><cx "zo'e, as a translation for “something”">  XE "zo'e: as a translation for \“something\”"   <cx "something, unspecified definite with “zo'e”">  XE "something: unspecified definite with \“zo'e\”"   The cmavo “zo'e” indicates that a sumti has been omitted (indeed, even “zo'e” itself can be omitted in this case, as explained in <a href=chap7.html>Chapter 7</a>) and the listener must fill in the correct value from context. In other words, <a href=#e2d2>Example 2.2 </a>means “‘You-know-what’ sees me.”
<p>
However, <a href=#e2d1>Example 2.1 </a>is just as likely to assert simply that there is someone who sees me, in which case a correct translation is:
<p>
<lx "da">  XE "da"   <cx "da, as a translation for “something”">  XE "da: as a translation for \“something\”"   <pre><a name=e2d3>2.3)	da zo'u da viska mi
	There-is-an-X such-that X sees me.
</pre><cx "existential claims, definition">  XE "existential claims: definition"   <cx "da, contrasted with zo'e">  XE "da: contrasted with zo'e"   <cx "zo'e, contrasted with da">  XE "zo'e: contrasted with da"   <a href=#e2d3>Example 2.3 </a>does not presuppose that the listener knows who sees the speaker, but simply tells the listener that there is someone who sees the speaker. Statements of this kind are called “existential claims”. (Formally, the one doing the seeing is not restricted to being a person; it could be an animal or — in principle — an inanimate object. We will see in <a href=#s4>Section 4 </a>how to represent such restrictions.)
<p>
<lx "zo'u">  XE "zo'u"   <lx "ZOhU">  XE "ZOhU selma’o"   <cx "prenex, explanation">  XE "prenex: explanation"   <cx "prenex, syntax of">  XE "prenex: syntax of"   <cx "variables, logical">  XE "variables: logical"   <cx "logical variables, notation convention">  XE "logical variables: notation convention"   <a href=#e2d3>Example 2.3 </a>has a two-part structure: there is the part “da zo'u”, called the prenex, and the part “da viska mi”, the main bridi. Almost any Lojban bridi can be preceded by a prenex, which syntactically is any number of sumti followed by the cmavo “zo'u” (of selma'o ZOhU). For the moment, the sumti will consist of one or more of the cmavo “da”, “de”, and “di” (of selma'o KOhA), glossed in the literal translations as “X”, “Y”, and “Z” respectively. By analogy to the terminology of symbolic logic, these cmavo are called “variables”.

<p>
Here is an example of a prenex with two variables:
<p>
<ex "somebody loves somebody">  XE "somebody loves somebody: example“  <pre><a name=e2d4>2.4)	da de zo'u da prami de
	There-is-an-X there-is-a-Y such that X loves Y.
	Somebody loves somebody.
</pre><cx "somebody, contrasted with somebody else">  XE "somebody: contrasted with somebody else"   <cx "logical variables, effect of using multiple different">  XE "logical variables: effect of using multiple different"   In <a href=#e2d4>Example 2.4</a>, the literal interpretation of the two variables “da” and “de” as “there-is-an-X” and “there-is-a-Y” tells us that there are two things which stand in the relationship that one loves the other. It might be the case that the supposed two things are really just a single thing that loves itself; nothing in the Lojban version of <a href=#e2d4>Example 2.4 </a>rules out that interpretation, which is why the colloquial translation does not say “Somebody loves somebody else.” The things referred to by different variables may be different or the same. (We use “somebody” here rather than “something” for naturalness; lovers and beloveds are usually persons, though the Lojban does not say so.)
<p>
<cx "logical variables, with multiple appearances in bridi">  XE "logical variables: with multiple appearances in bridi"   It is perfectly all right for the variables to appear more than once in the main bridi:
<p>
<ex "somebody loves self">  XE "somebody loves self: example“  <pre><a name=e2d5>2.5)	da zo'u da prami da
	There-is-an-X such that X loves X
	Somebody loves himself/herself.
</pre><cx "da prami da, contrasted with da prami de">  XE "da prami da: contrasted with da prami de"   <cx "da prami de, contrasted with da prami da">  XE "da prami de: contrasted with da prami da"   What <a href=#e2d5>Example 2.5 </a>claims is fundamentally different from what <a href=#e2d4>Example 2.4 </a>claims, because “da prami da” is not structurally the same as “da prami de”. However,
<p>
<cx "logical variables, effect of global substitution">  XE "logical variables: effect of global substitution"   <pre><a name=e2d6>2.6)	de zo'u de prami de
	There-is-a-Y such that Y loves Y
</pre>means exactly the same thing as <a href=#e2d5>Example 2.5</a>; it does not matter which variable is used as long as they are used consistently.
<p>
It is not necessary for a variable to be a sumti of the main bridi directly:
<p>
<ex "somebody's dog">  XE "somebody's dog: example“  <pre><a name=e2d7>2.7)	da zo'u le da gerku cu viska mi
	There-is-an-X such-that the of-X dog sees me
	Somebody's dog sees me
</pre>is perfectly correct even though the “da” is used only in a possessive construction. (Possessives are explained in <a href=chap8.html>Chapter 8</a>.)
<p>
<cx "logical variable, when not in main bridi">  XE "logical variables: when not in main bridi"   It is very peculiar, however, even if technically grammatical, for the variable not to appear in the main bridi at all:
<p>
<ex "Ralph">  XE "Ralph: example“  <pre><a name=e2d8>2.8)	da zo'u la ralf. gerku
	There is something such that Ralph is a dog.
</pre>has a variable bound in a prenex whose relevance to the claim of the following bridi is completely unspecified.
<p>
<a name=s3><h3>Universal claims</h3>
<p>
What happens if we substitute “everything” for “something” in <a href=#e2d1>Example 2.1</a>? We get:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d1>3.1)	Everything sees me.
</pre><cx "universal claims, explanation">  XE "universal claims: explanation"   Of course, this example is false, because there are many things which do not see the speaker. It is not easy to find simple truthful examples of so-called universal claims (those which are about everything), so bear with us for a while. (Indeed, some Lojbanists tend to avoid universal claims even in other languages, since they are so rarely true in Lojban.)
<p>
The Lojban translation of <a href=#e3d1>Example 3.1 </a>is
 <ex "everything sees me">  XE "everything sees me: example“  <pre><a name=e3d2>3.2)	ro da zo'u da viska mi
	For-every X :  X sees me.
</pre><lx "ro">  XE "ro"   <lx "ro da">  XE "ro da"   <cx "everything, expressing with “ro da”">  XE "everything: expressing with \“ro da\”"   When the variable cmavo “da” is preceded by “ro”, the combination means “For every X” rather than “There is an X”. Superficially, these English formulations look totally unrelated: <a href=#s6>Section 6 </a>will bring them within a common viewpoint. For the moment, accept the use of “ro da” for “everything” on faith.
<p>
Here is a universal claim with two variables:
<p>
<ex "everything loves everything">  XE "everything loves everything: example“  <pre><a name=e3d3>3.3)	ro da ro de zo'u da prami de
	For-every X, for-every Y :  X loves Y.
	Everything loves everything.
</pre><p>Again, X and Y can represent the same thing, so <a href=#e3d3>Example 3.3 </a>does not mean “Everything loves everything else.” Furthermore, because the claim is universal, it is about every thing, not merely every person, so we cannot use “everyone” or “everybody” in the translation.
<p>
<cx "mixed claim, definition">  XE "mixed claim: definition"   <cx "existential, mixed claim with universal">  XE "existential: mixed claim with universal"   <cx "universal, mixed claim with existential">  XE "universal: mixed claim with existential"   Note that “ro” appears before both “da” and “de”. If “ro” is omitted before either variable, we get a mixed claim, partly existential like those of <a href=#s2>Section 2</a>, partly universal.
<p>
<ex "everything sees something">  XE "everything sees something: example“  <pre><a name=e3d4>3.4)	ro da de zo'u da viska de
	For-every X, there-is-a-Y :  X sees Y.
	Everything sees something.
</pre><ex "something sees everything">  XE "something sees everything: example“  <pre><a name=e3d5>3.5)	da ro de zo'u da viska de
	There-is-an-X such-that-for-every-Y :  X sees Y.
	Something sees everything.
</pre><cx "logical variables, effect of order in prenex">  XE "logical variables: effect of order in prenex"   <a href=#e3d{4}>Examples 3.4 </a>and <a href=#e3d5>3.5 </a>mean completely different things. <a href=#e3d4>Example 3.4 </a>says that for everything, there is something which it sees, not necessarily the same thing seen for every seer. <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5</a>, on the other hand, says that there is a particular thing which can see everything that there is (including itself). Both of these are fairly silly, but they are different kinds of silliness.
<p>
There are various possible translations of universal claims in English: sometimes we use “anybody/anything” rather than “everybody/everything”. Often it makes no difference which of these is used: when it does make a difference, it is a rather subtle one which is explained in <a href=#s8>Section 8</a>.
<p>
<a name=s4><h3>Restricted claims: “da poi”</h3>
<p>
<cx "universal claims, restricting">  XE "universal claims: restricting"   <cx "restricted claims, definition">  XE "restricted claims: definition"   The universal claims of <a href=#s3>Section 3 </a>are not only false but absurd: there is really very little to be said that is both true and non-trivial about every object whatsoever. Furthermore, we have been glossing over the distinction between “everything” and “everybody” and the other pairs ending in “-thing” and “-body”. It is time to bring up the most useful feature of Lojban variables: the ability to restrict their ranges.

Relative clauses are described in detail in <a href=chap8.html>Chapter 8</a>, but the kind we will need at present consist of “poi” followed by a bridi (often just a selbri) terminated with “ku'o” or “vau” (which can usually be elided). Consider the difference between
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d1>4.1)	da zo'u da viska la djim.
	There-is-an-X :  X sees Jim.
	Something sees Jim.
</pre>and

<pre><a name=e4d2>4.2)	da poi prenu zo'u da viska la djim.
	There-is-an-X which is-a-person :  X sees Jim.
	Someone sees Jim.
</pre><cx "something, contrasted with someone">  XE "something: contrasted with someone"   In <a href=#e4d1>Example 4.1</a>, the variable “da” can refer to any object whatever; there are no restrictions on it. In <a href=#e4d2>Example 4.2</a>, “da” is restricted by the “poi prenu” relative clause to persons only, and so “da poi prenu” translates as “someone.” (The difference between “someone” and “somebody” is a matter of English style, with no real counterpart in Lojban.) If <a href=#e4d2>Example 4.2 </a>is true, then <a href=#e4d1>Example 4.1 </a>must be true, but not necessarily vice versa.
<p>
<cx "relative clauses, use in restricting universal claims">  XE “relative clause: use in restricting universal claims"   <cx "universal claims, restricting">  XE "universal claims: restricting"   Universal claims benefit even more from the existence of relative clauses. Consider
<p>
<ex "everything breathes">  XE "everything breathes: example“  <pre><a name=e4d3>4.3)	ro da zo'u da vasxu
	For-every X :  X breathes
	Everything breathes
</pre>and
<p>
<cx "dog breathes">  XE "dog breathes"   <pre><a name=e4d4>4.4)	ro da poi gerku zo'u da vasxu
	For-every X which is-a-dog :  X breathes.
	Every dog breathes.
	Each dog breathes.
	All dogs breathe.
</pre><a href=#e4d3>Example 4.3 </a>is a silly falsehood, but <a href=#e4d4>Example 4.4 </a>is an important truth (at least if applied in a timeless or potential sense: see <a href=chap10.html>Chapter 10</a>). Note the various colloquial translations “every dog”, “each dog”, and “all dogs”. They all come to the same thing in Lojban, since what is true of every dog is true of all dogs. “All dogs” is treated as an English plural and the others as singular, but Lojban makes no distinction.
<p>
If we make an existential claim about dogs rather than a universal one, we get:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d5>4.5)	da poi gerku zo'u da vasxu
	There-is-an-X which is-a-dog :  X breathes.
	Some dog breathes.
</pre><a name=s5><h3>Dropping the prenex</h3>
<p>
<cx "prenex, considerations for dropping">  XE "prenex: considerations for dropping"   It isn't really necessary for every Lojban bridi involving variables to have a prenex on the front. In fact, none of the examples we've seen so far required prenexes at all! The rule for dropping the prenex is simple: if the variables appear in the same order within the bridi as they did in the prenex, then the prenex is superfluous. However, any “ro” or “poi” appearing in the prenex must be transferred to the first occurrence of the variable in the main part of the bridi. Thus, <a href=#e2d3>Example 2.3 </a>becomes just:

<p>
<pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	da viska mi
	There-is-an-X-which sees me.
	Something sees me.
</pre>and <a href=#e4d4>Example 4.4 </a>becomes:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d2>5.2)	ro da poi gerku cu vasxu
	For-every X which is-a-dog, it-breathes.
	Every dog breathes.
</pre><cx "prenex, purpose of">  XE "prenex: purpose of"   <cx "prenex, effect of order of variables in">  XE "prenex: effect of order of variables in"   You might well suppose, then, that the purpose of the prenex is to allow the variables in it to appear in a different order than the bridi order, and that would be correct. Consider
<p>
<cx "everyone bitten by dog">  XE "everyone bitten by dog"   <pre><a name=e5d3>5.3)	ro da poi prenu ku'o de poi gerku ku'o zo'u de batci da
	For-every X which is-a-person, there-is-a-Y which is-a-dog:  Y bites X.
</pre><p>The prenex of <a href=#e5d3>Example 5.3 </a>is like that of <a href=#e3d4>Example 3.4 </a>(but with relative clauses): it notes that the following bridi is true of every person with respect to some dog, not necessarily the same dog for each. But in the main bridi part, the “de” appears before the “da”. Therefore, the true translation is
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d4>5.4)	Every person is bitten by some dog (or other).
</pre><p>If we tried to omit the prenex and move the “ro” and the relative clauses into the main bridi, we would get:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d5>5.5)	de poi gerku cu batci ro da poi prenu
	There-is-a-Y which is-a-dog which-bites every Y which is-a-person
	Some dog bites everyone.
</pre><ex "Fido">  XE "Fido: example“    XE  selma’o"dog bites: example"  which has the structure of <a href=#e3d5>Example 3.5</a>: it says that there is a dog (call him Fido) who bites, has bitten, or will bite every person that has ever existed! We can safely rule out Fido's existence, and say that <a href=#e5d5>Example 5.5 </a>is false, while agreeing to <a href=#e5d3>Example 5.3</a>.
<p>
<cx "universal claims, dangers of using">  XE "universal claims: dangers of using"   Even so, <a href=#e5d3>Example 5.3 </a>is most probably false, since some people never experience dogbite. Examples like 5.3 and 4.4 (might there be some dogs which never have breathed, because they died as embryos?) indicate the danger in Lojban of universal claims even when restricted. In English we are prone to say that “Everyone says” or that “Everybody does” or that “Everything is” when in fact there are obvious counterexamples which we are ignoring for the sake of making a rhetorical point. Such statements are plain falsehoods in Lojban, unless saved by a context (such as tense) which implicitly restricts them.

Since it is the order in which variables appear that matters, we can say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d6>5.6)	ro da poi prenu cu se batci de poi gerku
	Every-X which is-a-person is-bitten-by some-Y which is-a-dog.
</pre>using the conversion operator “se” (explained in <a href=chap5.html>Chapter 5</a>) to change the selbri “batci” (“bites”) into “se batci” (“is bitten by”). The translation given in <a href=#e5d4>Example 5.4 </a>uses the corresponding strategy in English, since English does not have prenexes (except in strained “logician's English”). This implies that a sentence with both a universal and an existential variable can't be freely converted with “se”; one must be careful to preserve the order of the variables.

For example,
<p>
<ex "weapon against self">  XE "weapon against self: example“  <pre><a name=e5d7>5.7)	di poi prenu zo'u

	There-is-a-Z which is-a-person :
this-thing is-a-weapon for-use-against-Z by-Z
	This is a weapon for someone to use against himself/herself.
</pre>(in which “di” is used rather than “da” just for variety) loses its prenex as follows:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d8>5.8)	ti xarci di poi prenu ku'o di
	This-thing is-a-weapon-for-use-against some-Z which is-a-person by-Z.
</pre><cx "prenex, dropping for terseness">  XE "prenex: dropping for terseness"   As the examples in this section show, dropping the prenex makes for terseness of expression often even greater than that of English (Lojban is meant to be an unambiguous language, not necessarily a terse or verbose one), provided the rules are observed.

<a name=s6><h3>Variables with generalized quantifiers</h3>
<p>
<lx "PA">  XE "PA selma’o"   <cx "quantifiers, with logical variables">  XE “quantifier: with logical variables"   So far, we have seen variables with either nothing in front, or with the cmavo “ro” in front. Now “ro” is a Lojban number, and means “all”; thus “ro prenu” means “all persons”, just as “re prenu” means “two persons”. In fact, unadorned “da” is also taken to have an implicit number in front of it, namely “su'o”, which means “at least one”. Why is this? Consider <a href=#e2d3>Example 2.3 </a>again, this time with an explicit “su'o”:
<p>
<cx "something, expressing using “su'o”">  XE "something: expressing using \“su'o\”"   <ex "something sees me">  XE "something sees me: example“  <lx "su'o">  XE "su'o"   <pre><a name=e6d1>6.1)	su'o da zo'u da viska mi
	For-at-least-one X :  X sees me.
	Something sees me.
</pre><p>From this version of <a href=#e2d3>Example 2.3</a>, we understand the speaker's claim to be that of all the things that there are, at least one of them sees him or her. The corresponding universal claim, <a href=#e3d2>Example 3.2</a>, says that of all the things that exist, every one of them can see the speaker.
<p>
<cx "numbers, on logical variables">  XE "numbers: on logical variables"   Any other number can be used instead of “ro” or “su'o” to precede a variable. Then we get claims like:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d2>6.2)	re da zo'u da viska mi
	For-two-Xes :  X sees me.
	Two things see me.
</pre><cx "numbers, Lojban contrasted with English on exactness">  XE "numbers: Lojban contrasted with English on exactness"   <cx "numbers, English contrasted with Lojban on exactness">  XE "numbers: English contrasted with Lojban on exactness"   This means that exactly two things, no more or less, saw the speaker on the relevant occasion. In English, we might take “Two things see me” to mean that at least two things see the speaker, but there might be more; in Lojban, though, that claim would have to be made as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d3>6.3)	su'ore da zo'u da viska mi
	For-at-least-two Xes :  X sees me.
</pre>which would be false if nothing, or only one thing, saw the speaker, but not otherwise. We note the “su'o” here meaning “at least”; “su'o” by itself is short for “su'opa” where “pa” means “one”, as is explained in <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18</a>.
<p>
<cx "prenex, removing when numeric quantifiers present">  XE "prenex: removing when numeric quantifiers present"   The prenex may be removed from <a href=#e6d{2}>Examples 6.2 </a>and <a href=#e6d3>6.3 </a>as from the others, leading to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d4>6.4)	re da viska mi
	Two Xes see me.
</pre>and
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d5>6.5)	su'ore da viska mi

In fact, “ro prenu”, a so-called “indefinite description”, is shorthand for “ro DA poi prenu”, where “DA” represents a fictitious variable that hasn't been used yet and will not be used in future. (Even if all three of “da”, “de”, and “di” have been used up, it does not matter, for there are ways of getting more variables, discussed in <a href=#s14>Section 14</a>.) So in fact
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d6>6.6)	re prenu viska mi
	Two persons see me.
</pre>is short for
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d7>6.7)	re da poi prenu cu viska mi
	Two Xes which are-persons see me.
</pre>which in turn is short for:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d8>6.8)	re da poi prenu zo'u da viska mi
	For-two Xes which are-persons :  X sees me.
</pre><cx "order of variables, in moving to prenex">  XE "order of variables: in moving to prenex"   Note that when we move more than one variable to the prenex (along with its attached relative clause), we must make sure that the variables are in the same order in the prenex as in the bridi proper.

<p>
<cx "indefinite sumti, multiple in sentence">  XE "indefinite sumti: multiple in sentence"   <cx "distribution of quantified sumti">  XE "distribution of quantified sumti"   Let us consider a sentence containing two quantifier expressions neither of which is “ro” or “su'o” (remembering that “su'o” is implicit where no explicit quantifier is given):
<p>
<ex "three dogs bite two men">  XE  selma’o"dogs bite: example"    XE "three dogs bite two men: example“  <pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	ci gerku cu batci re nanmu
	Three dogs bite two men.
</pre><cx "indefinite sumti, meaning when multiple in sentence">  XE "indefinite sumti: meaning when multiple in sentence"   <cx "multiple indefinite sumti, meaning">  XE "multiple indefinite sumti: meaning"   The question raised by <a href=#e7d1>Example 7.1 </a>is, does each of the dogs bite the same two men, or is it possible that there are two different men per dog, for six men altogether? If the former interpretation is taken, the number of men involved is fixed at two; but if the latter, then the speaker has to be taken as saying that there might be any number of men between two and six inclusive. Let us transform <a href=#e7d1>Example 7.1 </a>step by step as we did with <a href=#e6d6>Example 6.6</a>:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d2>7.2)	ci da poi gerku cu batci re de poi nanmu
	Three Xes which are-dogs bite two Ys which are-men.
</pre>(Note that we need separate variables “da” and “de”, because of the rule that says each indefinite description gets a variable never used before or since.)
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d3>7.3)	ci da poi gerku ku'o re de poi nanmu zo'u da batci de
	For-three Xes which are-dogs, for-two Ys which are-men :  X bites Y.
</pre><p>Here we see that indeed each of the dogs is said to bite two men, and it might be different men each time; a total of six biting events altogether.
<p>
<cx "multiple indefinite sumti, effect of re-ordering in sentence">  XE "multiple indefinite sumti: effect of re-ordering in sentence"   How then are we to express the other interpretation, in which just two men are involved? We cannot just reverse the order of variables in the prenex to
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d4>7.4)	re de poi nanmu ku'o ci da poi gerku zo'u da batci de
	For-two Ys which are-men, for-three Xes which are-dogs, X bites Y
</pre>for although we have now limited the number of men to exactly two, we end up with an indeterminate number of dogs, from three to six. The distinction is called a “scope distinction”: in <a href=#e7d2>Example 7.2</a>, “ci gerku” is said to have wider scope than “re nanmu”, and therefore precedes it in the prenex. In <a href=#e7d4>Example 7.4 </a>the reverse is true.
<p>
<cx "multiple indefinite sumti, expressing with equal scope">  XE "multiple indefinite sumti: expressing with equal scope"   <lx "ce'e">  XE "ce'e"   <lx "CEhE">  XE "CEhE selma’o"   <lx "nu'i">  XE "nu'i"   <lx "nu'u">  XE "nu'u"   <lx "NUhI">  XE "NUhI selma’o"   <lx "NUhU">  XE "NUhU selma’o"   <cx "multiple indefinite sumti scope, in termset">  XE "multiple indefinite sumti scope: in termset"   <cx "termset, effect on scope of multiple indefinite sumti">  XE "termset: effect on scope of multiple indefinite sumti"   The solution is to use a termset, which is a group of terms either joined by “ce'e” (of selma'o CEhE) between each term, or else surrounded by “nu'i” (of selma'o NUhI) on the front and “nu'u” (of selma'o NUhU) on the rear. Terms (which are either sumti or sumti prefixed by tense or modal tags) that are grouped into a termset are understood to have equal scope:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d5>7.5)	ci gerku ce'e re nanmu cu batci
	nu'i ci gerku re nanmu [nu'u] cu batci
	Three dogs [plus] two men, bite.
</pre>which picks out two groups, one of three dogs and the other of two men, and says that every one of the dogs bites each of the men. The second Lojban version uses forethought; note that “nu'u” is an elidable terminator, and in this case can be freely elided.
<p>

They too can be grouped in termsets, but usually need not be, except for the “lo” case which functions like the case without a descriptor. Unless an actual quantifier precedes it, “le nanmu” means “ro le nanmu”, as is explained in <a href=chap6.html>Chapter 6</a>. Two sumti with “ro” quantifiers are independent of order, so:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d6>7.6)	[ro] le ci gerku cu batci [ro] le re nanmu
	[All of] the three dogs bite [all of] the two men.
</pre>means that each of the dogs specified bites each of the men specified, for six acts of biting altogether. However, if there is an explicit quantifier before “le” other than “ro”, the problems of this section reappear.
<p>
<a name=s8><h3>The problem of “any”</h3>

Consider the English sentence

A sumti of the type “ro da poi klama” requires that there are things which “klama”: Lojban universal claims always imply the corresponding existential claims as well. <a href=#e8d1>Example 8.1</a>, on the other hand, does not require that there are any people who go to the store: it simply states, conditionally, that if there is anyone who goes to the store, he or she walks across the field as well. This conditional form mirrors the true Lojban translation of <a href=#e8d1>Example 8.1</a>:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d3>8.3)	ro da zo'u ganai da klama le zarci gi cadzu le foldi
	For-every X:  if X is-a-goer-to the store then X is-a-walker-on the field.
</pre><cx "any, as a universal claim, later restricted">  XE "any: as a universal claim, later restricted"   Although <a href=#e8d3>Example 8.3 </a>is a universal claim as well, its universality only implies that there are objects of some sort or another in the universe of discourse. Because the claim is conditional, nothing is implied about the existence of goers-to-the-store or of walkers-on-the-field, merely that any entity which is one is also the other.
<p>
<cx "any, as an existential claim">  XE "any: as an existential claim"   There is another use of “any” in English that is not universal but existential. Consider

</pre><p>What to do? Well, the x2 place of “nitcu” can be filled with an event as well as an object, and in fact <a href=#e8d5>Example 8.5 </a>can also be paraphrased as:

By default, a variable always behaves as if it is bound in the prenex which (notionally) is attached to the smallest enclosing bridi, and its scope does not extend beyond that bridi. However, the variable may be placed in an outer prenex explicitly:
<p>

The main difference is that in <a href=#e8d9>Example 8.9</a>, the “da” is said to exist in the real world of the outer bridi; but in <a href=#e8d7>Example 8.7</a>, the existence is only within the inner bridi, which is a mere event that need not necessarily come to pass. So <a href=#e8d9>Example 8.9 </a>means

</pre><cx "any, expressing as existential by variable in subordinate bridi">  XE "any: expressing as existential by variable in subordinate bridi"   which is what <a href=#e8d6>Example 8.6 </a>says, whereas <a href=#e8d7>Example 8.7 </a>turns out to be an effective translation of our original <a href=#e8d1>Example 8.1</a>.

<cx "bridi negation, two forms of">  XE "bridi negation: two forms of"   As explained in <a href=chap15.html>Chapter 15</a>, the negation of a bridi is usually accomplished by inserting “na” at the beginning of the selbri:
<p>
<lx "na">  XE "na"   <pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	mi na klama le zarci
	I [false] go-to the store.
	It is false that I go to the store.
	I don't go to the store.
</pre><lx "naku">  XE "naku"   The other form of bridi negation is expressed by using the compound cmavo “naku” in the prenex, which is identified and compounded by the lexer before looking at the sentence grammar. In Lojban grammar, “naku” is then treated like a sumti. In a prenex, “naku” means precisely the same thing as the logician's “it is not the case that” in a similar English context. (Outside of a prenex, “naku” is also grammatically treated as a single entity — the equivalent of a sumti — but does not have this exact meaning; we'll discuss these other situations in <a href=#s11>Section 11</a>.)

This form is called “external bridi negation”, as opposed to “internal bridi negation” using “na”. The prenex version of <a href=#e9d1>Example 9.1 </a>is
<p>

Thus “for no x” means the same thing as “it is false for some x”, and the corresponding Lojban “noda” can be replaced by “naku su'oda”. Making this substitution, we get:

<a name=s10><h3>bridi negation and logical connectives</h3>
<p>
<cx "negation and logical connectives, caveat for logic chapter discussions">  XE "negation and logical connectives: caveat for logic chapter discussions"   <cx "logical connectives and negation, caveat for logic chapter discussions">  XE "logical connectives and negation: caveat for logic chapter discussions"   <cx "bridi negation and logical connectives">  XE "bridi negation and logical connectives"   <cx "logical connectives and bridi negation">  XE "logical connectives and bridi negation"   A complete discussion of logical connectives appears in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>. What is said here is intentionally quite incomplete and makes several oversimplifications.
<p>
A logical connective is a cmavo or compound cmavo. In this chapter, we will make use of the logical connectives “and” and “or” (where “or” really means “and/or”, “either or both”). The following simplified recipes explain how to make some logical connectives:
<p>
<cx "logical connective recipes, simplified for logic chapter discussion">  XE “logical connectives: recipes, simplified for logic chapter discussion"   <dl compact><dt><dd>To logically connect two Lojban sumti with “and”, put them both in the bridi and separate them with the cmavo “.e”.
<p><dt><dd>To logically connect two Lojban bridi with “and”, replace the regular separator cmavo “.i” with the compound cmavo “.ije”.
<p><dt><dd>To logically connect two Lojban sumti with “or”, put them both in the bridi and separate them with the cmavo “.a”.
<p><dt><dd>To logically connect two Lojban bridi with “or”, replace the regular separator cmavo “.i” with the compound cmavo “.ija”.
</dl><p>More complex logical connectives also exist; in particular, one may place “na” before “.e” or “.a”, or between “.i” and “je” or “ja”; likewise, one may place “nai” at the end of a connective. Both “na” and “nai” have negative effects on the sumti or bridi being connected. Specifically, “na” negates the first or left-hand sumti or bridi, and “nai” negates the second or right-hand one.
<p>
Whenever a logical connective occurs in a sentence, that sentence can be expanded into two sentences by repeating the common terms and joining the sentences by a logical connective beginning with “.i”. Thus the following sentence:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d1>10.1)	mi .e do klama ti
	I and you come here.
</pre>can be expanded to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d2>10.2)	mi klama ti  .ije do klama ti
	I come here, and, you come here.
</pre><p>The same type of expansion can be performed for any logical connective, with any valid combination of “na” or “nai” attached. No change in meaning occurs under such a transformation.
<p>
Clearly, if we know what negation means in the expanded sentence forms, then we know what it means in all of the other forms. But what does negation mean between sentences?
<p>
<cx "negation between sentences, compared with bridi negation">  XE "negation between sentences: compared with bridi negation"   <cx "bridi negation, compared with negation between sentences">  XE "bridi negation: compared with negation between sentences"   <cx "negation between sentences, meaning of">  XE "negation between sentences: meaning of"   The mystery is easily solved. A negation in a logical expression is identical to the corresponding bridi negation, with the negator placed at the beginning of the prenex. Thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d3>10.3)	mi .enai do prami roda
	I, and not you, love everything.
</pre>expands to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d4>10.4)	mi prami roda  .ijenai do prami roda
	I love everything, and-not, you love everything.
</pre>and then into prenex form as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d5>10.5)	roda zo'u mi prami da  .ije naku zo'u do prami da
	For each thing:  I love it, and it is false that you love (the same) it.
</pre><cx "quantifier scope, in multiple connected sentences">  XE "quantifier scope: in multiple connected sentences"   By the rules of predicate logic, the “ro” quantifier on “da” has scope over both sentences. That is, once you've picked a value for “da” for the first sentence, it stays the same for both sentences. (The “da” continues with the same fixed value until a new paragraph or a new prenex resets the meaning.)
<p>
Thus the following example has the indicated translation:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d6>10.6)	su'oda zo'u mi prami da
		.ije naku zo'u do prami da
	For at least one thing:  I love that thing.
		And it is false that:  you love that (same) thing.
	There is something that I love that you don't.

</pre><cx "prenex manipulation, rules">  XE "prenex manipulation: rules"   If you remember only two rules for prenex manipulation of negations, you won't go wrong:
<p>
<cx "prenex manipulation, moving naku past bound variable">  XE "prenex manipulation: moving naku past bound variable"   <dl compact><dt><dd>Within a prenex, whenever you move “naku” past a bound variable (da, de, di, etc.), you must invert the quantifier.

</dl><a name=s11><h3>Using “naku” outside a prenex</h3>
<p>
Let us consider the English sentence
<p>
<ex "some do not go to school">  XE "some do not go to school: example“  <pre><a name=e11d1>11.1)	Some children do not go to school.
</pre><p>We cannot express this directly with “na”; the apparently obvious translation

This involves putting “naku” before the selbri, instead of a “na”. “naku” is clearly a contradictory negation, given its parallel with prenex bridi negation. Using “naku”, <a href=#e11d1>Example 11.1 </a>can be expressed as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d4>11.4)	su'oda poi verba naku klama su'ode poi ckule
	Some which-are children don't go-to some which-are schools.
	Some children don't go to a school.
</pre><cx "naku, compared with sumti in grammar">  XE "naku: compared with sumti in grammar"   Although it is not technically a sumti, “naku” can be used in most of the places where a sumti may appear. We'll see what this means in a moment.
<p>
<cx "naku, as creating a negation boundary">  XE "naku: as creating a negation boundary"   <cx "naku, effect on moving quantifiers">  XE "naku: effect on moving quantifiers"   <cx "quantifiers, effect of moving naku">  XE “quantifier: effect of moving naku"   <cx "inverting quantifiers, with movement relative to naku">  XE "inverting quantifiers: with movement relative to naku"   When you use “naku” within a bridi, you are explicitly creating a negation boundary. As explained in <a href=#s9>Section 9</a>, when a prenex negation boundary expressed by “naku” moves past a quantifier, the quantifier has to be inverted. The same is true for “naku” in the bridi proper. We can move “naku” to any place in the sentence where a sumti can go, inverting any quantifiers that the negation boundary crosses. Thus, the following are equivalent to <a href=#e11d4>Example 11.4 </a>(no good English translations exist):
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d5>11.5)	su'oda poi verba cu klama rode poi ckule naku
	For some children, for every school, they don't go to it.
<a name=e11d6>11.6)	su'oda poi verba cu klama naku su'ode poi ckule
	Some children don't go to (some) school(s).
<a name=e11d7>11.7)	naku roda poi verba cu klama su'ode poi ckule
	It is false that all children go to some school(s).
</pre><p>In <a href=#e11d5>Example 11.5</a>, we moved the negation boundary rightward across the quantifier of “de”, forcing us to invert it. In <a href=#e11d7>Example 11.7 </a>we moved the negation boundary across the quantifier of “da”, forcing us to invert it instead. <a href=#e11d6>Example 11.6 </a>merely switched the selbri and the negation boundary, with no effect on the quantifiers.
<p>
<cx "inverting quantifiers, with movement relative to fixed negation">  XE "inverting quantifiers: with movement relative to fixed negation"   The same rules apply if you rearrange the sentence so that the quantifier crosses an otherwise fixed negation. You can't just convert the selbri of <a href=#e11d4>Example 11.4 </a>and rearrange the sumti to produce
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d8>11.8)	su'ode poi ckule ku'o naku se klama roda poi verba
	Some schools aren't gone-to-by every child.
</pre><cx "conversion with se, effect of naku negation boundary on">  XE "conversion with se: effect of naku negation boundary on"   <cx "naku negation boundary, effect on conversion with se">  XE "naku negation boundary: effect on conversion with se"   <cx "naku negation, rationale for considering an advanced technique">  XE "naku negation: rationale for considering an advanced technique"   or rather, <a href=#e11d8>Example 11.8 </a>means something completely different from <a href=#e11d4>Example 11.4</a>. Conversion with “se” under “naku” negation is not symmetric; not all sumti are treated identically, and some sumti are not invariant under conversion. Thus, internal negation with “naku” is considered an advanced technique, used to achieve stylistic compatibility with natural languages.
<p>
It isn't always easy to see which quantifiers have to be inverted in a sentence. <a href=#e11d4>Example 11.4 </a>is identical in meaning to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d9>11.9)	su'o verba naku klama su'o ckule
	Some children don't go-to some school.
</pre><cx "indefinite sumti, as implicit quantification">  XE "indefinite sumti: as implicit quantification"   but in <a href=#e11d9>Example 11.9</a>, the bound variables “da” and “de” have been hidden.

<cx "exporting negation to prenex, internal bridi negation contrasted with “naku”">  XE "exporting negation to prenex: internal bridi negation contrasted with \“naku\”"   <cx "exporting negation to prenex, “naku” contrasted with internal bridi negation">  XE "exporting negation to prenex: \“naku\” contrasted with internal bridi negation"   It is trivial to export an internal bridi negation expressed with “na” to the prenex, as we saw in <a href=#s9>Section 9</a>; you just move it to the left end of the prenex. In comparison, it is non-trivial to export a “naku” to the prenex because of the quantifiers. The rules for exporting “naku” require that you export all of the quantified variables (implicit or explicit) along with “naku”, and you must export them from left to right, in the same order that they appear in the sentence. Thus <a href=#e11d4>Example 11.4 </a>goes into prenex form as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d10>11.10)	su'oda poi verba ku'o naku

	For some X which is a child, it is not the case that
		there is a Y which is a school such that:  X goes to Y.
</pre><p>We can now move the “naku” to the left end of the prenex, getting a contradictory negation that can be expressed with “na”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d11>11.11)	naku roda poi verba
		su'ode poi ckule zo'u da klama de
	It is not the case that for all X's which are children,
		there is a Y which is a school such that:  X goes to Y.
</pre>from which we can restore the quantified variables to the sentence, giving:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d12>11.12)	naku zo'u roda poi verba cu klama su'ode poi ckule
	It is not the case that all children go to some school.
</pre>or more briefly

	All children [false] go-to some school(s).
</pre><cx "conversion of sentence with quantified variables, technique">  XE "conversion of sentence with quantified variables: technique"   As noted in <a href=#s5>Section 5</a>, a sentence with two different quantified variables, such as <a href=#e11d13>Example 11.13</a>, cannot always be converted with “se” without first exporting the quantified variables. When the variables have been exported, the sentence proper can be converted, but the quantifier order in the prenex must remain unchanged:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d14>11.14)	roda poi verba
		su'ode poi ckule zo'u de na se klama da
	It is not the case that for all X's which are children,

If you use “na” negation in such a sentence, nothing special need be done. If you use “naku” negation, then quantified variables that cross the negation boundary must be inverted.
<p>
<cx "negation manipulation, “naku” contrasted with “na” in difficulty of">  XE "negation manipulation: \“naku\” contrasted with \“na\” in difficulty of"   <cx "negation manipulation, “na” contrasted with “naku” in difficulty of">  XE "negation manipulation: \“na\” contrasted with \“naku\” in difficulty of"   Clearly, if all of Lojban negation was built on “naku” negation instead of “na” negation, logical manipulation in Lojban would be as difficult as in natural languages. In <a href=#s12>Section 12</a>, for example, we'll discuss DeMorgan's Law, which must be used whenever a sumti with a logical connection is moved across a negation boundary.
<p>
<cx "naku, in linked sumti places">  XE "naku: in linked sumti places"   Since “naku” has the grammar of a sumti, it can be placed almost anywhere a sumti can go, including “be” and “bei” clauses; it isn't clear what these mean, and we recommend avoiding such constructs.
<p>
<cx "naku, multiple in sentence">  XE "naku: multiple in sentence"   <cx "double negation, and naku">  XE "double negation: and naku"   You can put multiple “naku”s in a sentence, each forming a separate negation boundary. Two adjacent “naku”s in a bridi are a double negative and cancel out:

</pre><p>Other expressions using two “naku”s may or may not cancel out. If there is no quantified variable between them, then the “naku”s cancel.

Negation with internal “naku” is clumsy and non-intuitive for logical manipulations, but then, so are the natural language features it is emulating.

<a name=s12><h3>Logical Connectives and DeMorgan's Law</h3>
<p>
<cx "logical connectives within negation, effects of expansion on">  XE "logical connectives within negation: effects of expansion on"   <cx "negations with logical connectives, effects on expansion of sentence">  XE "negations with logical connectives: effects on expansion of sentence"   DeMorgan's Law states that when a logical connective between terms falls within a negation, then expanding the negation requires a change in the connective. Thus (where “p” and “q” stand for terms or sentences) “not (p or q)” is identical to “not p and not q”, and “not (p and q)” is identical to “not p or not q”. The corresponding changes for the other two basic Lojban connectives are: “not (p equivalent to q)” is identical to “not p exclusive-or not q”, and “not (p whether-or-not q)” is identical to both “not p whether-or-not q” and “not p whether-or-not not q”. In any Lojban sentence having one of the basic connectives, you can substitute in either direction from these identities. (These basic connectives are explained in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>.)
<p>
The effects of DeMorgan's Law on the logical connectives made by modifying the basic connectives with “nai”, “na” and “se” can be derived directly from these rules; modify the basic connective for DeMorgan's Law by substituting from the above identities, and then, apply each “nai”, “na” and “se” modifier of the original connectives.

These sentences make use of forethought logical connectives, which are explained in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>. It suffices to know that “ga” and “gi”, used before each of a pair of sumti or bridi, mean “either” and “or” respectively, and that “ge” and “gi” used similarly mean “both” and “and”. Furthermore, “ga”, “ge”, and “gi” can all be suffixed with “nai” to negate the bridi or sumti that follows.
<p>
<lx "na">  XE "na"   <lx "naku zo'u">  XE "naku zo'u"   <cx "na, and negation boundary">  XE "na: and negation boundary"   <cx "naku zo'u, and negation boundary">  XE "naku zo'u: and negation boundary"   <cx "bridi negation, and negation boundary">  XE "bridi negation: and negation boundary"   <cx "bridi negation, and DeMorgan's Law">  XE "bridi negation: and DeMorgan's Law"   We have defined “na” and “naku zo'u” as, respectively, internal and external bridi negation. These forms being identical, the negation boundary always remains at the left end of the prenex. Thus, exporting or importing negation between external and internal bridi negation forms never requires DeMorgan's Law to be applied. <a href=#e12d1>Example 12.1 </a>and <a href=#e12d2>Example 12.2 </a>are exactly equivalent:
<p>
<ex "go to Paris or Rome">  XE "go to Paris or Rome: example“  <pre><a name=e12d1>12.1)	la djan. na klama ga la paris. gi la rom.
	John [false] goes-to either Paris or Rome.

However, <a href=#e12d1>Example 12.1 </a>and related examples are not sumti negations, but rather expand to form two logically connected sentences. In such a situation, DeMorgan's Law must be applied. For instance, <a href=#e12d2>Example 12.2 </a>expands to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d3>12.3)	ge la djan. la paris. na klama
		gi la djan. la rom. na klama
	[It is true that] both John, to-Paris, [false] goes, 
		and John, to-Rome, [false] goes.
</pre><p>The “ga” and “gi”, meaning “either-or”, have become “ge” and “gi”, meaning “both-and”, as a consequence of moving the negators into the individual bridi.
<p>
<cx "bridi-tail logical connection, and DeMorgan's Law">  XE "bridi-tail logical connection: and DeMorgan's Law"   <cx "DeMorgan's Law, and bridi-tail logical connection">  XE "DeMorgan's Law: and bridi-tail logical connection"   Here is another example of DeMorgan's Law in action, involving bridi-tail logical connection (explained in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>):
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d4>12.4)	la djein. le zarci na ge dzukla gi bajrykla
	Jane to-the market [false] both walks and runs.
<a name=e12d5>12.5)	la djein. le zarci ganai dzukla ginai bajrykla
	Jane to-the market either [false] walks or [false] runs.
	Jane to-the market if walks then ([false] runs).
</pre>(Placing “le zarci” before the selbri makes sure that it is properly associated with both parts of the logical connection. Otherwise, it is easy to erroneously leave it off one of the two sentences.)
<p>
<cx "transformations with logical connectives, steps">  XE "transformations with logical connectives: steps"   It is wise, before freely doing transformations such as the one from <a href=#e12d4>Example 12.4 </a>to <a href=#e12d5>Example 12.5</a>, that you become familiar with expanding logical connectives to separate sentences, transforming the sentences, and then recondensing. Thus, you would prove the transformation correct by the following steps. By moving its “na” to the beginning of the prenex as a “naku”, <a href=#e12d4>Example 12.4 </a>becomes:

<p>
<pre><a name=e12d6>12.6)	naku zo'u la djein. le zarci ge dzukla gi bajrykla
	It is false that :  Jane to-the market (both walks and runs).
</pre><p>And by dividing the bridi with logically connected selbri into two bridi,
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d7>12.7)	naku zo'u ge la djein. le zarci dzukla
		gi la djein. le zarci bajrykla
	It-is-false-that:  both (Jane to-the market walks)
		and (Jane to-the market runs).
</pre>is the result.
<p>
At this expanded level, we apply DeMorgan's Law to distribute the negation in the prenex across both sentences, to get
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d8>12.8)	ga la djein. le zarci na dzukla gi la djein. le zarci na bajrykla
	Either Jane to-the market [false] walks, or Jane to-the market [false] runs.
</pre>which is the same as
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d9>12.9)	ganai la djein. le zarci dzukla ginai la djein. le zarci bajrykla
	If Jane to-the market walks, then Jane to-the market [false] runs.
	If Jane walks to the market, then she doesn't run.
</pre>which then condenses down to <a href=#e12d5>Example 12.5</a>.

</pre><p>That <a href=#e12d10>Example 12.10 </a>and <a href=#e12d11>Example 12.11 </a>mean the same should become evident by studying the English. It is a good exercise to work through the Lojban and prove that they are the same.

<a name=s13><h3>selbri variables</h3>
<p>
<lx "GOhA">  XE "GOhA selma’o"   <lx "bu'a">  XE "bu'a"   <lx "bu'e">  XE "bu'e"   <lx "bu'i">  XE "bu'i"   <cx "logical variables, for selbri">  XE "logical variables: for selbri"   <cx "selbri logical variables">  XE "selbri logical variables"   In addition to the variables “da”, “de”, and “di” that we have seen so far, which function as sumti and belong to selma'o KOhA, there are three corresponding variables “bu'a”, “bu'e”, and “bu'i” which function as selbri and belong to selma'o GOhA. These new variables allow existential or universal claims which are about the relationships between objects rather than the objects themselves. We will start with the usual silly examples; the literal translation will represent “bu'a”, “bu'e” and “bu'i” with F, G, and H respectively.
<p>
<ex "some relationship">  XE "some relationship: example“  <pre><a name=e13d1>13.1)	su'o bu'a zo'u la djim. bu'a la djan. 
	For-at-least-one relationship-F :  Jim stands-in-relationship-F to-John.
	There's some relationship between Jim and John.
</pre><cx "selbri variables, prenex form as indefinite description">  XE "selbri variables: prenex form as indefinite description"   The translations of <a href=#e13d1>Example 13.1 </a>show how unidiomatic selbri variables are in English; Lojban sentences like <a href=#e13d1>Example 13.1 </a>need to be totally reworded in English. Furthermore, when a selbri variable appears in the prenex, it is necessary to precede it with a quantifier such as “su'o”; it is ungrammatical to just say “bu'a zo'u”. This rule is necessary because only sumti can appear in the prenex, and “su'o bu'a” is technically a sumti — in fact, it is an indefinite description like “re nanmu”, since “bu'a” is grammatically equivalent to a brivla like “nanmu”. However, indefinite descriptions involving the bu'a-series cannot be imported from the prenex.
<p>
<cx "selbri variables, form when not in prenex">  XE "selbri variables: form when not in prenex"   When the prenex is omitted, the preceding number has to be omitted too:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d2>13.2)	la djim. bu'a la djan.
	Jim stands-in-at-least-one-relationship to-John.
</pre><cx "selbri variables, quantified">  XE "selbri variables: quantified"   As a result, if the number before the variable is anything but “su'o”, the prenex is required:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d3>13.3)	ro bu'a zo'u la djim. bu'a la djan.
	For-every relationship-F : Jim stands-in-relationship-F to-John.
	Every relationship exists between Jim and John.
</pre><a href=#e13d1>Example 13.1 </a>and <a href=#e13d2>Example 13.2 </a>are almost certainly true: Jim and John might be brothers, or might live in the same city, or at least have the property of being jointly human. <a href=#e13d3>Example 13.3 </a>is palpably false, however; if Jim and John were related by every possible relationship, then they would have to be both brothers and father-and-son, which is impossible.
<p>
<a name=s14><h3>A few notes on variables</h3>
<p>
<cx "quantifier, on previously quantified variable">  XE "quantifier: on previously quantified variable"   A variable may have a quantifier placed in front of it even though it has already been quantified explicitly or implicitly by a previous appearance, as in:
<p>
<ex "three cats white, and two big">  XE "three cats white: and two big, example“  <pre><a name=e14d1>14.1)	ci da poi mlatu cu blaci .ije re da cu barda
	Three Xs which-are cats are white, and two Xs are big.
</pre><p>What does <a href=#e14d1>Example 14.1 </a>mean? The appearance of “ci da” quantifies “da” as referring to three things, which are restricted by the relative clause to be cats. When “re da” appears later, it refers to two of the those three things — there is no saying which ones. Further uses of “da” alone, if there were any, would refer once more to the three cats, so the requantification of “da” is purely local.
<p>
<cx "prenex scope, for sentences joined by ijeks">  XE "prenex scope: for sentences joined by ijeks"   <cx "prenex scope, for sentences joined by .i">  XE "prenex scope: for sentences joined by .i"   <cx "prenex scope, informal">  XE "prenex scope: informal"   <cx "prenex scope, in embedded bridi">  XE "prenex scope: in embedded bridi"   <cx "prenex scope, in relative clauses">  XE "prenex scope: in relative clauses"   <cx "prenex scope, in abstractions">  XE "prenex scope: in abstractions"   In general, the scope of a prenex that precedes a sentence extends to following sentences that are joined by ijeks (explained in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>) such as the “.ije” in <a href=#e14d1>Example 14.1</a>. Theoretically, a bare “.i” terminates the scope of the prenex. Informally, however, variables may persist for a while even after an “.i”, as if it were an “.ije”. Prenexes that precede embedded bridi such as relative clauses and abstractions extend only to the end of the clause, as explained in <a href=#s8>Section 8</a>. A prenex preceding “tu'e <dots>…</dots>tu'u” long-scope brackets persists until the “tu'u”, which may be many sentences or even paragraphs later.
<p>
<cx "logical variables, creating more by subscripting">  XE "logical variables: creating more by subscripting"   <cx "subscripts, use with logical variables">  XE "subscripts: use with logical variables"   If the variables “da”, “de”, and “di” (or the selbri variables “bu'a”, “bu'e”, and “bu'i”) are insufficient in number for handling a particular problem, the Lojban approach is to add a subscript to any of them. Each possible different combination of a subscript and a variable cmavo counts as a distinct variable in Lojban. Subscripts are explained in full in <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19</a>, but in general consist of the cmavo “xi” (of selma'o XI) followed by a number, one or more lerfu words forming a single string, or a general mathematical expression enclosed in parentheses.
<p>
A quantifier can be prefixed to a variable that has already been bound either in a prenex or earlier in the bridi, thus:

<p>
<pre><a name=e14d2>14.2)	ci da poi prenu cu se ralju pa da
	Three Xs which are-persons are-led-by one-of X
	Three people are led by one of them.
</pre><p>The “pa da” in <a href=#e14d2>Example 14.2 </a>does not specify the number of things to which “da” refers, as the preceding “ci da” does. Instead, it selects one of them for use in this sumti only. The number of referents of “da” remains three, but a single one (there is no way of knowing which one) is selected to be the leader.
<p>
<a name=s15><h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
<cx "logic and Lojban, more aspects">  XE "logic and Lojban: more aspects"   This chapter is incomplete. There are many more aspects of logic that I neither fully understand nor feel competent to explain, neither in abstract nor in their Lojban realization. Lojban was designed to be a language that makes predicate logic speakable, and achieving that goal completely will need to wait for someone who understands both logic and Lojban better than I do. I can only hope to have pointed out the areas that are well-understood (and by implication, those that are not).

<br>
As Easy As A-B-C? The Lojban Letteral System And Its Uses</h2>
<h6>$Revision: 4.1 $<br>
mkhtml: 1.1</h6></p></center>
<p>
<a name=s1><h3>What's a letteral, anyway?</h3>
<p>
<cx "Brown, James Cooke, and “letteral”">  XE "Brown: James Cooke, and \“letteral\”"   <cx "letteral, definition">  XE "letteral: definition"   <cx "letter, alphabet">  XE "letter: alphabet"   James Cooke Brown, the founder of the Loglan Project, coined the word “letteral” (by analogy with “numeral”) to mean a letter of the alphabet, such as “f” or “z”. A typical example of its use might be
<p>
<ex "fourteen “e”s">  XE "fourteen \“e\”s: example“  <pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	There are fourteen occurrences of the letteral
		“e” in this sentence.
</pre><cx "lerfu, definition">  XE "lerfu: definition"   (Don't forget the one within quotation marks.) Using the word “letteral” avoids confusion with “letter”, the kind you write to someone. Not surprisingly, there is a Lojban gismu for “letteral”, namely “lerfu”, and this word will be used in the rest of this chapter.
<p>
<cx "Latin, alphabet of Lojban">  XE "Latin: alphabet of Lojban"   <cx "alphabet, Latin used for Lojban">  XE "alphabet: Latin used for Lojban"   Lojban uses the Latin alphabet, just as English does, right? Then why is there a need for a chapter like this? After all, everyone who can read it already knows the alphabet. The answer is twofold:
<p>
<cx "alphabet, words for letters in, rationale">  XE "alphabet: words for letters in, rationale"   First, in English there are a set of words that correspond to and represent the English lerfu. These words are rarely written down in English and have no standard spellings, but if you pronounce the English alphabet to yourself you will hear them: ay, bee, cee, dee <dots>…</dots>. They are used in spelling out words and in pronouncing most acronyms. The Lojban equivalents of these words are standardized and must be documented somehow.
<p>
<cx "alphabets, words for non-Lojban letters, rationale">  XE "alphabet: words for non-Lojban letters, rationale"   Second, English has names only for the lerfu used in writing English. (There are also English names for Greek and Hebrew lerfu: English-speakers usually refer to the Greek lerfu conventionally spelled “phi” as “fye”, whereas “fee” would more nearly represent the name used by Greek-speakers. Still, not all English-speakers know these English names.) Lojban, in order to be culturally neutral, needs a more comprehensive system that can handle, at least potentially, all of the world's alphabets and other writing systems.
<p>
Letterals have several uses in Lojban: in forming acronyms and abbreviations, as mathematical symbols, and as pro-sumti — the equivalent of English pronouns.
<p>
<cx "lerfu, contrasted with lerfu word">  XE "lerfu: contrasted with lerfu word"   <cx "lerfu word, contrasted with lerfu">  XE "lerfu word: contrasted with lerfu"   <cx "letter, contrasted with word for the letter">  XE "letter: contrasted with word for the letter"   In earlier writings about Lojban, there has been a tendency to use the word “lerfu” for both the letterals themselves and for the Lojban words which represent them. In this chapter, that tendency will be ruthlessly suppressed, and the term “lerfu word” will invariably be used for the latter. The Lojban equivalent would be “lerfu valsi” or “lervla”.
<p>
<a name=s2><h3>A to Z in Lojban, plus one</h3>
<p>
<cx "lerfu words, Lojban coverage requirement">  XE "lerfu words: Lojban coverage requirement"   The first requirement of a system of lerfu words for any language is that they must represent the lerfu used to write the language. The lerfu words for English are a motley crew: the relationship between “doubleyou” and “w” is strictly historical in nature; “aitch” represents “h” but has no clear relationship to it at all; and “z” has two distinct lerfu words, “zee” and “zed”, depending on the dialect of English in question.

<p>
<cx "lerfu words, formation rules">  XE "lerfu words: formation rules"   <cx "lerfu words, for vowels">  XE "lerfu words: for vowels"   <cx "lerfu words, for consonants">  XE "lerfu words: for consonants"   <cx "lerfu word, for “ ' ”">  XE "lerfu word: for \“ ' \”"   <lx "BY">  XE "BY selma’o"   All of Lojban's basic lerfu words are made by one of three rules:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>to get a lerfu word for a vowel, add “bu”;
to get a lerfu word for a consonant, add “y”;
the lerfu word for “ ' ”is “.y'y”.
</dl><cx "lerfu words, table of Lojban">  XE "lerfu words: table of Lojban"   Therefore, the following table represents the basic Lojban alphabet:
<p>
<pre> 	'	a	b	c	d	e
	.y'y.	.abu	by.	cy.	dy.	.ebu
	f	g	i	j	k	l
	fy.	gy.	.ibu	jy.	ky.	ly.
	m	n	o	p	r	s
	my.	ny.	.obu	py.	ry.	sy.
	t	u	v	x	y	z
	ty.	.ubu	vy.	xy.	.ybu	zy.
</pre><cx "lerfu words for vowels, pause requirement before">  XE "lerfu words for vowels: pause requirement before"   <cx "lerfu words, consonant words contrasted with vowel words">  XE "lerfu words: consonant words contrasted with vowel words"   <cx "lerfu words, vowel words contrasted with consonant words">  XE "lerfu words: vowel words contrasted with consonant words"   <cx "lerfu words, composed of single cmavo">  XE "lerfu words: composed of single cmavo"   <cx "lerfu words, composed of compound cmavo">  XE "lerfu words: composed of compound cmavo"   <lx "bu">  XE "bu"   <lx "BU">  XE "BU selma’o"   <cx "bu, effect on preceding word">  XE "bu: effect on preceding word"   There are several things to note about this table. The consonant lerfu words are a single syllable, whereas the vowel and “ ' ” lerfu words are two syllables and must be preceded by pause (since they all begin with a vowel). Another fact, not evident from the table but important nonetheless, is that “by” and its like are single cmavo of selma'o BY, as is “.y'y”. The vowel lerfu words, on the other hand, are compound cmavo, made from a single vowel cmavo plus the cmavo “bu” (which belongs to its own selma'o, BU). All of the vowel cmavo have other meanings in Lojban (logical connectives, sentence separator, hesitation noise), but those meanings are irrelevant when “bu” follows.
<p>
Here are some illustrations of common Lojban words spelled out using the alphabet above:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	ty. .abu ny. ry. .ubu
	“t” “a” “n” “r” “u”
<a name=e2d2>2.2)	ky. .obu .y'y. .abu
	“k” “o” “ ' ” “a”
</pre><cx "spelling out words, Lojban contrasted with English in usefulness">  XE "spelling out words: Lojban contrasted with English"   <cx "lerfu words, effect of systematic formulation">  XE "lerfu words: effect of systematic formulation"   Spelling out words is less useful in Lojban than in English, for two reasons: Lojban spelling is phonemic, so there can be no real dispute about how a word is spelled; and the Lojban lerfu words sound more alike than the English ones do, since they are made up systematically. The English words “fail” and “vale” sound similar, but just hearing the first lerfu word of either, namely “eff” or “vee”, is enough to discriminate easily between them — and even if the first lerfu word were somehow confused, neither “vail” nor “fale” is a word of ordinary English, so the rest of the spelling determines which word is meant. Still, the capability of spelling out words does exist in Lojban.
<p>
<cx "lerfu words ending with “y”, pause after, rationale">  XE "lerfu words ending with \“y\”: pause after, rationale"   Note that the lerfu words ending in “y” were written (in <a href=#e2d1>Example 2.1 </a>and <a href=#e2d2>Example 2.2</a>) with pauses after them. It is not strictly necessary to pause after such lerfu words, but failure to do so can in some cases lead to ambiguities:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d3>2.3)	mi cy. claxu
	I lerfu-“c” without
	I am without (whatever is referred to by) the letter “c”.
</pre>without a pause after “cy” would be interpreted as:
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d4>2.4)	micyclaxu
	(Observative:) doctor-without
	Something unspecified is without a doctor.
</pre><p>A safe guideline is to pause after any cmavo ending in “y” unless the next word is also a cmavo ending in “y”. The safest and easiest guideline is to pause after all of them.
<p>
<a name=s3><h3>Upper and lower cases</h3>
<p>
<cx "upper-case letters, Lojban usage contrasted with English">  XE "upper-case letters: Lojban usage contrasted with English"   <cx "upper-case letters, English usage contrasted with Lojban">  XE "upper-case letters: English usage contrasted with Lojban"   <cx "lower-case letters, Lojban usage contrasted with English">  XE "lower-case letters: Lojban usage contrasted with English"   <cx "lower-case letters, English usage contrasted with Lojban">  XE "lower-case letters: English usage contrasted with Lojban"   <cx "stress, irregular marked with upper-case">  XE "stress: irregular marked with upper-case"   <cx "capital letters, use in Lojban">  XE "capital letters: use in Lojban"   <cx "lower case letters, use in Lojban">  XE "lower case letters: use in Lojban"   Lojban doesn't use lower-case (small) letters and upper-case (capital) letters in the same way that English does; sentences do not begin with an upper-case letter, nor do names. However, upper-case letters are used in Lojban to mark irregular stress within names, thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d1>3.1)	.iVAN.
	the name “Ivan” in Russian/Slavic pronunciation.
</pre><cx "upper-case, lerfu word for">  XE "upper-case: lerfu word for"   <cx "lower-case, lerfu word for">  XE "lower-case: lerfu word for"   <lx "ga'e">  XE "ga'e"   <lx "to'a">  XE "to'a"   <cx "case, upper/lower specification">  XE "case: upper/lower specification"   It would require far too many cmavo to assign one for each upper-case and one for each lower-case lerfu, so instead we have two special cmavo “ga'e” and “to'a” representing upper case and lower case respectively. They belong to the same selma'o as the basic lerfu words, namely BY, and they may be freely interspersed with them.
<p>
<lx "ga'e">  XE "ga'e"   <cx "lower-case word, effect on following lerfu words">  XE "lower-case word: effect on following lerfu words"   The effect of “ga'e” is to change the interpretation of all lerfu words following it to be the upper-case version of the lerfu. An occurrence of “to'a” causes the interpretation to revert to lower case. Thus, “ga'e .abu” means not “a” but “A”, and Ivan's name may be spelled out thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d2>3.2)	.ibu ga'e vy. .abu ny. to'a
	i [upper] V A N [lower]
</pre>The cmavo and compound cmavo of this type will be called “shift words”.
<p>
<cx "shift word, scope">  XE "shift word: scope"   How long does a shift word last? Theoretically, until the next shift word that contradicts it or until the end of text. In practice, it is common to presume that a shift word is only in effect until the next word other than a lerfu word is found.
<p>
<cx "shift word, for single letter">  XE "shift word: for single letter"   <lx "LAU">  XE "LAU selma’o"   <cx "shift, single-letter, grammar of">  XE "shift: single-letter, grammar of"   It is often convenient to shift just a single letter to upper case. The cmavo “tau”, of selma'o LAU, is useful for the purpose. A LAU cmavo must always be immediately followed by a BY cmavo or its equivalent: the combination is grammatically equivalent to a single BY. (See <a href=#s14>Section 14 </a>for details.)
<p>
<cx "chemical elements, use of single-letter shift for">  XE "chemical elements: use of single-letter shift for"   A likely use of “tau” is in the internationally standardized symbols for the chemical elements. Each element is represented using either a single upper-case lerfu or one upper-case lerfu followed by one lower-case lerfu:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d3>3.3)	tau sy.
	[single shift] S
	S (chemical symbol for sulfur)
</pre><pre><a name=e3d4>3.4)	tau sy. .ibu

<a name=s4><h3>The universal “bu”</h3>
<p>
<cx "bu, for extension of lerfu word set">  XE "bu: for extension of lerfu word set"   <cx "lerfu word set extension, with bu">  XE "lerfu word set extension: with bu"   So far we have seen “bu” only as a suffix to vowel cmavo to produce vowel lerfu words. Originally, this was the only use of “bu”. In developing the lerfu word system, however, it proved to be useful to allow “bu” to be attached to any word whatsoever, in order to allow arbitrary extensions of the basic lerfu word set.

Compound cmavo do not count as words for this purpose. The special cmavo “ba'e”, “za'e”, “zei”, “zo”, “zoi”, “la'o”, “lo'u”, “si”, “sa”, “su”, and “fa'o” may not have “bu” attached, because they are interpreted before “bu” detection is done; in particular,

It is also illegal to attach “bu” to itself, but more than one “bu” may be attached to a word; thus “.abubu” is legal, if ugly. (Its meaning is not defined, but it is presumably different from “.abu”.) It does not matter if the word is a cmavo, a cmene, or a brivla. All such words suffixed by “bu” are treated grammatically as if they were cmavo belonging to selma'o BY. However, if the word is a cmene it is always necessary to precede and follow it by a pause, because otherwise the cmene may absorb preceding or following words.

For example, the Lojban name for the “happy face” is “.uibu”, based on the attitudinal “.ui” that means “happiness”. Likewise, the “smiley face”, written “:-)” and used on computer networks to indicate humor, is called “zo'obu” The existence of these names does not mean that you should insert “.uibu” into running Lojban text to indicate that you are happy, or “zo'obu” when something is funny; instead, use the appropriate attitudinal directly.

Many more such lerfu words will probably be invented in future.

The written space is mandatory here, because “denpa” and “slaka” are normal gismu with normal stress: “denpabu” would be a fu'ivla (word borrowed from another language into Lojban) stressed “denPAbu”. No pause is required between “denpa” (or “slaka”) and “bu”, though.
<p>
<a name=s5><h3>Alien alphabets</h3>
<p>
As stated in <a href=#s1>Section 1</a>, Lojban's goal of cultural neutrality demands a standard set of lerfu words for the lerfu of as many other writing systems as possible. When we meet these lerfu in written text (particularly, though not exclusively, mathematical text), we need a standard Lojbanic way to pronounce them.
<p>
There are certainly hundreds of alphabets and other writing systems in use around the world, and it is probably an unachievable goal to create a single system which can express all of them, but if perfection is not demanded, a usable system can be created from the raw material which Lojban provides.
<p>
<cx "letters, non-Lojban, representation with names">  XE "letters: non-Lojban, representation with names"   <ex "alpha">  XE "alpha: example“  One possibility would be to use the lerfu word associated with the language itself, Lojbanized and with “bu” added. Indeed, an isolated Greek “alpha” in running Lojban text is probably most easily handled by calling it “.alfas. bu”. Here the Greek lerfu word has been made into a Lojbanized name by adding “s” and then into a Lojban lerfu word by adding “bu”. Note that the pause after “.alfas.” is still needed.
<p>
<cx "letters, non-Lojban, representation with consonant-word + bu">  XE "letters: non-Lojban, representation with consonant-word + bu"   Likewise, the easiest way to handle the Latin letters “h”, “q”, and “w” that are not used in Lojban is by a consonant lerfu word with “bu” attached. The following assignments have been made:
<p>
<pre>	.y'y.bu	h
	ky.bu	q
	vy.bu	w
</pre><ex "quack">  XE "quack: example“  As an example, the English word “quack” would be spelled in Lojban thus:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	ky.bu .ubu .abu cy. ky.
	“q” “u” “a” “c” “k”
</pre><cx "letters, sound contrasted with symbol for spelling">  XE "letters: sound contrasted with symbol for spelling"   <cx "letters, symbol contrasted with sound for spelling">  XE "letters: symbol contrasted with sound for spelling"   Note that the fact that the letter “c” in this word has nothing to do with the sound of the Lojban letter “c” is irrelevant; we are spelling an English word and English rules control the choice of letters, but we are speaking Lojban and Lojban rules control the pronunciations of those letters.
<p>
A few more possibilities for Latin-alphabet letters used in languages other than English:
<p>
<pre>			ty.bu		þ&thorn; (thorn)
			dy.bu		ð&edh; (edh)
<cx "letters, non-Lojban, representation with consonant-word + bu, drawback">  XE "letters: non-Lojban, representation with consonant-word + bu, drawback"   However, this system is not ideal for all purposes. For one thing, it is verbose. The native lerfu words are often quite long, and with “bu” added they become even longer: the worst-case Greek lerfu word would be “.Omikron. bu”, with four syllables and two mandatory pauses. In addition, alphabets that are used by many languages have separate sets of lerfu words for each language, and which set is Lojban to choose?
</pre><cx "language shift, rationale for">  XE "language shift: rationale for"   <cx "language shift, effect on following words">  XE "language shift: effect on following words"   <cx "language shift, choice of Lojban-lerfu-word counterpart">  XE "language shift: choice of Lojban-lerfu-word counterpart"   <cx "letters, non-Lojban, representation with language-shift">  XE "letters: non-Lojban, representation with language-shift"   The alternative plan, therefore, is to use a shift word similar to those introduced in <a href=#s3>Section 3</a>. After the appearance of such a shift word, the regular lerfu words are re-interpreted to represent the lerfu of the alphabet now in use. After a shift to the Greek alphabet, for example, the lerfu word “ty” would represent not Latin “t” but Greek “tau”. Why “tau”? Because it is, in some sense, the closest counterpart of “t” within the Greek lerfu system. In principle it would be all right to map “ty.” to “phi” or even “omega”, but such an arbitrary relationship would be extremely hard to remember.
<p>
<cx "language shift, interaction with bu">  XE "language shift: interaction with bu"   <cx "bu, interaction with language shift">  XE "bu: interactions"   Where no obvious closest counterpart exists, some more or less arbitrary choice must be made. Some alien lerfu may simply not have any shifted equivalent, forcing the speaker to fall back on a “bu” form. Since a “bu” form may mean different things in different alphabets, it is safest to employ a shift word even when “bu” forms are in use.
<p>
Shifts for several alphabets have been assigned cmavo of selma'o BY:

The BY word which must follow any LAU cmavo would typically be a name representing the alphabet with “bu” suffixed:
<p>
<ex "Devanagari">  XE "Devanagari: example“  <pre><a name=e5d2>5.2)	zai .devanagar. bu

</pre><cx "language shift, standardization of">  XE "language shift: standardization of"   Unlike the cmavo above, these shift words have not been standardized and probably will not be until someone actually has a need for them. (Note the “.”characters marking leading and following pauses.)

These traditional “font and face” distinctions are also represented by shift words, indicated with the cmavo “ce'a” (of selma'o LAU) and a following BY word:
<p>
<ex "Helvetica font">  XE "Helvetica font: example“  <pre><a name=e5d5>5.5)	ce'a .xelveticas. bu

It is more general than “lo'a”, which changes the alphabet only, potentially leaving font and case shifts in place.
<p>
Several sections at the end of this chapter contain tables of proposed lerfu word assignments for various languages.
<p>
<a name=s6><h3>Accent marks and compound lerfu words</h3>
<p>
<cx "diacritical marks, as lerfu">  XE "diacritical marks: as lerfu"   <cx "letters, non-Lojban, representation of diacritical marks on">  XE "letters: non-Lojban, representation of diacritical marks on"   <ex "accent mark, a diacritical mark">  XE "accent mark: a diacritical mark"   <ex "umlaut, a diacritical mark">  XE "umlaut: a diacritical mark"   <ex "circumflex, a diacritical mark">  XE "circumflex: a diacritical mark"   <ex "cedilla, a diacritical mark">  XE "cedilla: a diacritical mark"   <ex "tilde, a diacritical mark">  XE "tilde: a diacritical mark"   Many languages that make use of the Latin alphabet add special marks to some of the lerfu they use. French, for example, uses three accent marks above vowels, called (in English) “acute”, “grave”, and “circumflex”. Likewise, German uses a mark called “umlaut”; a mark which looks the same is also used in French, but with a different name and meaning.
<p>
<cx "diacritical marks, problem of position">  XE "diacritical marks: problem of position"   These marks may be considered lerfu, and each has a corresponding lerfu word in Lojban. So far, no problem. But the marks appear over lerfu, whereas the words must be spoken (or written) either before or after the lerfu word representing the basic lerfu. Typewriters (for mechanical reasons) and the computer programs that emulate them usually require their users to type the accent mark before the basic lerfu, whereas in speech the accent mark is often pronounced afterwards (for example, in German “a umlaut” is preferred to “umlaut a”).
<p>
<cx "diacritical marks, specifying with tei…foi">  XE "diacritical marks: specifying with tei…foi"   <lx "tei">  XE "tei"   <lx "foi">  XE "foi"   <lx "TEI">  XE "TEI selma’o"   <lx "FOI">  XE "FOI selma’o"   Lojban cannot settle this question by fiat. Either it must be left up to default interpretation depending on the language in question, or the lerfu-word compounding cmavo “tei” (of selma'o TEI) and “foi” (of selma'o FOI) must be used. These cmavo are always used in pairs; any number of lerfu words may appear between them, and the whole is treated as a single compound lerfu word. The French word “é&eacute;té&eacute;”, with acute accent marks on both “e” lerfu, could be spelled as:
<p>
<ex "accent mark">  XE "accent mark: example“  <ex "ete">  XE "été: example“  <pre><a name=e6d1>6.1)	tei .ebu .akut. bu foi ty. tei .akut. bu .ebu foi
	(“e” acute ) “t” ( acute “e” )
</pre><cx "diacritical marks, order of specification within tei…foi">  XE "diacritical marks: order of specification within tei…foi"   and it does not matter whether “akut. bu” appears before or after “.ebu”; the “tei<dots>…</dots>foi” grouping guarantees that the acute accent is associated with the correct lerfu. Of course, the level of precision represented by <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1 </a>would rarely be required: it might be needed by a Lojban-speaker when spelling out a French word for exact transcription by another Lojban-speaker who did not know French.
<p>
<cx "diacritical marks, problem with multiple on one lerfu">  XE "diacritical marks: problem with multiple on one lerfu"   This system breaks down in languages which use more than one accent mark on a single lerfu; some other convention must be used for showing which accent marks are written where in that case. The obvious convention is to represent the mark nearest the basic lerfu by the lerfu word closest to the word representing the basic lerfu. Any remaining ambiguities must be resolved by further conventions not yet established.
<p>
<cx "diacritical marks, considered as forming distinct letters">  XE "diacritical marks: considered as forming distinct letters"   <cx "accented letters, considered as distinct from unaccented">  XE "accented letters: considered as distinct from unaccented"   <cx "compound letters, native language, representing as distinct letters">  XE "compound letters: native language, representing as distinct letters"   <ex "Spanish ll">  XE "Spanish ll: example“  <ex "Spanish ch">  XE "Spanish ch: example“  Some languages, like Swedish and Finnish, consider certain accented lerfu to be completely distinct from their unaccented equivalents, but Lojban does not make a formal distinction, since the printed characters look the same whether they are reckoned as separate letters or not. In addition, some languages consider certain 2-letter combinations (like “ll” and “ch” in Spanish) to be letters; this may be represented by enclosing the combination in “tei<dots>…</dots>foi”.
<p>
<cx "lerfu words, forming new for non-Lojban letters using bu">  XE "lerfu words: forming new for non-Lojban letters using bu"   In addition, when discussing a specific language, it is permissible to make up new lerfu words, as long as they are either explained locally or well understood from context: thus Spanish “ll” or Croatian “lj” could be called “libu”, but that usage would not necessarily be universally understood.
<p>
<a href=#s19>Section 19 </a>contains a table of proposed lerfu words for some common accent marks.
<p>
<a name=s7><h3>Punctuation marks</h3>
<p>
<cx "punctuation lerfu words, mechanism for creating">  XE "punctuation lerfu words: mechanism for creating"   <lx "lau">  XE "lau"   <lx "LAU">  XE "LAU selma’o"   <cx "lau, effect on following lerfu word">  XE "lau: effect on following lerfu word"   Lojban does not have punctuation marks as such: the denpa bu and the slaka bu are really a part of the alphabet. Other languages, however, use punctuation marks extensively. As yet, Lojban does not have any words for these punctuation marks, but a mechanism exists for devising them: the cmavo “lau” of selma'o LAU. “lau” must always be followed by a BY word; the interpretation of the BY word is changed from a lerfu to a punctuation mark. Typically, this BY word would be a name or brivla with a “bu” suffix.
<p>
<cx "punctuation lerfu words, rationale for lau">  XE "punctuation lerfu words: rationale for lau"   Why is “lau” necessary at all? Why not just use a “bu”-marked word and announce that it is always to be interpreted as a punctuation mark? Primarily to avoid ambiguity. The “bu” mechanism is extremely open-ended, and it is easy for Lojban users to make up “bu” words without bothering to explain what they mean. Using the “lau” cmavo flags at least the most important of such nonce lerfu words as having a special function: punctuation. (Exactly the same argument applies to the use of “zai” to signal an alphabet shift or “ce'a” to signal a font shift.)
<p>
<cx "punctuation lerfu words, interaction with different alphabet systems">  XE "punctuation lerfu words: interaction with different alphabet systems"   Since different alphabets require different punctuation marks, the interpretation of a “lau”-marked lerfu word is affected by the current alphabet shift and the current font shift.
<p>
<a name=s8><h3>What about Chinese characters?</h3>
<p>
<cx "Chinese characters, contrasted with alphabets and syllabaries">  XE "Chinese characters: contrasted with alphabets and syllabaries"   <cx "kanji, contrasted with alphabets and syllabaries">  XE "kanji: contrasted with alphabets and syllabaries"   <cx "hiragana, contrasted with kanji">  XE "hiragana: contrasted with kanji"   <cx "syllabaries, lerfu word representation">  XE "syllabaries: lerfu word representation"   <cx "Amharic writing">  XE "Amharic writing"   Chinese characters (“han<sup>4</sup>zi<sup>4</sup>” in Chinese, “kanji” in Japanese) represent an entirely different approach to writing from alphabets or syllabaries. (A syllabary, such as Japanese hiragana or Amharic writing, has one lerfu for each syllable of the spoken language.) Very roughly, Chinese characters represent single elements of meaning; also very roughly, they represent single syllables of spoken Chinese. There is in principle no limit to the number of Chinese characters that can exist, and many thousands are in regular use.
<p>
It is hopeless for Lojban, with its limited lerfu and shift words, to create an alphabet which will match this diversity. However, there are various possible ways around the problem.
<p>
<cx "Chinese characters, representing based on pinyin spelling">  XE "Chinese characters: representing based on pinyin spelling"   <cx "kanji, representing based on romaji spelling">  XE "kanji: representing based on romaji spelling"   <cx "pinyin, as a basis for Chinese characters in Lojban lerfu words">  XE "pinyin: as a basis for Chinese characters in Lojban lerfu words"   <cx "romaji, as a basis for kanji characters in Lojban lerfu words">  XE "romaji: as a basis for kanji characters in Lojban lerfu words"   First, both Chinese and Japanese have standard Latin-alphabet representations, known as “pinyin” for Chinese and “romaji” for Japanese, and these can be used. Thus, the word “han<sup>4</sup>zi<sup>4</sup>” is conventionally written with two characters, but it may be spelled out as:
<p>
<ex "han^{4}zi^{4}">  XE "han4zi4: example“  <pre><a name=e8d1>8.1)	.y'y.bu .abu ny. vo zy. .ibu vo
	“h” “a” “n” 4 “z” “i” 4
</pre><cx "numeric digits in lerfu words, grammar considerations">  XE "numeric digits in lerfu words: grammar considerations"   <cx "lerfu words with numeric digits, grammar considerations">  XE "lerfu words with numeric digits: grammar considerations"   The cmavo “vo” is the Lojban digit “4”. It is grammatical to intersperse digits (of selma'o PA) into a string of lerfu words; as long as the first cmavo is a lerfu word, the whole will be interpreted as a string of lerfu words. In Chinese, the digits can be used to represent tones. Pinyin is more usually written using accent marks, the mechanism for which was explained in <a href=#s6>Section 6</a>.
<p>
The Japanese company named “Mitsubishi” in English is spelled the same way in romaji, and could be spelled out in Lojban thus:
<p>
<ex "Mitsubishi">  XE "Mitsubishi: example“  <pre><a name=e8d2>8.2)	my. .ibu ty. sy. .ubu by. .ibu sy. .y'y.bu .ibu
	“m” “i” “t” “s” “u” “b” “i” “s” “h” “i”
</pre><cx "Chinese characters, representing based on strokes">  XE "Chinese characters: representing based on strokes"   <cx "kanji, representing based on strokes">  XE "kanji: representing based on strokes"   Alternatively, a really ambitious Lojbanist could assign lerfu words to the individual strokes used to write Chinese characters (there are about seven or eight of them if you are a flexible human being, or about 40 if you are a rigid computer program), and then represent each character with a “tei”, the stroke lerfu words in the order of writing (which is standardized for each character), and a “foi”. No one has as yet attempted this project.
<p>
<a name=s9><h3>lerfu words as pro-sumti</h3>
<p>
<cx "lerfu string, definition">  XE "lerfu string: definition"   So far, lerfu words have only appeared in Lojban text when spelling out words. There are several other grammatical uses of lerfu words within Lojban. In each case, a single lerfu word or more than one may be used. Therefore, the term “lerfu string” is introduced: it is short for “sequence of one or more lerfu words”.

<p>
<cx "lerfu string, as pro-sumti">  XE "lerfu string: as pro-sumti"   A lerfu string may be used as a pro-sumti (a sumti which refers to some previous sumti), just like the pro-sumti “ko'a”, “ko'e”, and so on:
<p>
<ex "A loves B">  XE "A loves B: example“  <pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	.abu prami by.
	A loves B
</pre><p>In <a href=#e9d1>Example 9.1</a>, “.abu” and “by.” represent specific sumti, but which sumti they represent must be inferred from context.
<p>
<cx "lerfu string, as pro-sumti assigned by goi">  XE "lerfu string: as pro-sumti assigned by goi"   <lx "goi">  XE "goi"   Alternatively, lerfu strings may be assigned by “goi”, the regular pro-sumti assignment cmavo:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d2>9.2)	le gerku goi gy. cu xekri  .i gy. klama le zdani
	The dog, or G, is black. G goes to the house.
</pre><cx "lerfu string as pro-sumti, assumption of reference">  XE "lerfu string: as pro-sumti, assumption of reference"   There is a special rule that sometimes makes lerfu strings more advantageous than the regular pro-sumti cmavo. If no assignment can be found for a lerfu string (especially a single lerfu word), it can be assumed to refer to the most recent sumti whose name or description begins in Lojban with that lerfu. So <a href=#e9d2>Example 9.2 </a>can be rephrased:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d3>9.3)	le gerku cu xekri.  .i gy. klama le zdani
	The dog is black.  G goes to the house.
</pre>(A less literal English translation would use “D” for “dog” instead.)
<p>
Here is an example using two names and longer lerfu strings:
<p>
<ex "Steven Mark Jones">  XE "Steven Mark Jones: example“  <ex "Alexander Pavlovitch Kuznetsov">  XE "Alexander Pavlovitch Kuznetsov: example“  <pre><a name=e9d4>9.4)	la stivn. mark. djonz. merko  .i la .aleksandr. paliitc. kuzNIETsyf. rusko
		.i symyjy. tavla .abupyky. bau la lojban.
	Steven Mark Jones is-American. Alexander Pavlovitch Kuznetsov is-Russian.
		SMJ talks-to APK in Lojban.
</pre><p>Perhaps Alexander's name should be given as “ru'o.abupyky” instead.

<ex "A gives BC">  XE "A gives BC: example“  <pre><a name=e9d5>9.5)	.abu dunda by. cy.
	A gives B C
</pre><lx "boi">  XE "boi"   <lx "BOI">  XE "BOI selma’o"   <cx "boi, eliding from lerfu strings">  XE "boi: eliding from lerfu strings"   Does this mean that A gives B to C? No. “by. cy.” is a single lerfu string, although written as two words, and represents a single pro-sumti. The true interpretation is that A gives BC to someone unspecified. To solve this problem, we need to introduce the elidable terminator “boi” (of selma'o BOI). This cmavo is used to terminate lerfu strings and also strings of numerals; it is required when two of these appear in a row, as here. (The other reason to use “boi” is to attach a free modifier — subscript, parenthesis, or what have you — to a lerfu string.)  The correct version is:
<p>
<ex "A gives B to C">  XE "A gives B to C: example“  <pre><a name=e9d6>9.6)	.abu [boi] dunda by. boi cy. [boi]
	A gives B to C
</pre>where the two occurrences of “boi” in brackets are elidable, but the remaining occurrence is not. Likewise:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d7>9.7)	xy. boi ro [boi] prenu cu prami
	X all persons loves.
	X loves everybody.
</pre><cx "boi, required between pro-sumti lerfu string and quantifier">  XE "boi: required between pro-sumti lerfu string and quantifier"   <cx "pro-sumti lerfu strings, interaction with quantifiers and boi">  XE "pro-sumti: lerfu string, interaction with quantifier and boi"   requires the first “boi” to separate the lerfu string “xy.” from the digit string “ro”.
<p>
<a name=s10><h3>References to lerfu</h3>
<p>
<cx "lerfu, reference to">  XE "lerfu: reference to"   <cx "pro-sumti lerfu string, effect on reference to lerfu itself">  XE "pro-sumti: lerfu string, effect on reference to lerfu itself"   The rules of <a href=#s9>Section 9 </a>make it impossible to use unmarked lerfu words to refer to lerfu themselves. In the sentence:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d1>10.1)	.abu. cu lerfu
	A is-a-letteral.
</pre><lx "me'o">  XE "me'o"   <lx "LI">  XE "LI selma’o"   <cx "lerfu, referring to with me'o">  XE "lerfu: referring to with me'o"   the hearer would try to find what previous sumti “.abu” refers to. The solution to this problem makes use of the cmavo “me'o” of selma'o LI, which makes a lerfu string into a sumti representing that very string of lerfu. This use of “me'o” is a special case of its mathematical use, which is to introduce a mathematical expression used literally rather than for its value.
<p>
<ex "“a” is letteral">  XE "a is letteral: example“  <pre><a name=e10d2>10.2)	me'o .abu cu lerfu
	the-expression “a” is-a-letteral.
</pre><p>Now we can translate <a href=#e1d1>Example 1.1 </a>into Lojban:
<p>
<ex "four “e”s">  XE "four \“e\”s: example“  <pre><a name=e10d3>10.3)	dei vasru vo lerfu
		po'u me'o .ebu
	this-sentence contains four letterals
		which-are the-expression “e”.
	This sentence contains four “e”s.
</pre><p>Since the Lojban sentence has only four “e” lerfu rather than fourteen, the translation is not a literal one — but <a href=#e10d3>Example 10.3 </a>is a Lojban truth just as <a href=#e1d1>Example 1.1 </a>is an English truth. Coincidentally, the colloquial English translation of <a href=#e10d3>Example 10.3 </a>is also true!

<p>
<pre><a name=e10d4>10.4)	lu .abu li'u cu lerfu
	[quote] .abu [unquote] is-a-letteral.
</pre>(The single-word quote “zo” cannot be used, because “.abu” is a compound cmavo.) But <a href=#e10d4>Example 10.4 </a>is false, because it says:
<p>
<ex "word “abu”">  XE "word \“abu\”: example“   <pre><a name=e10d5>10.5)	The word “.abu” is a letteral
</pre>which is not the case; rather, the thing symbolized by the word “.abu” is a letteral. In Lojban, that would be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d6>10.6)	la'e lu .abu li'u cu lerfu
	The-referent-of [quote] .abu [unquote] is-a-letteral.
</pre>which is correct.

<cx "mathematics, use of lerfu strings in">  XE "mathematics: use of lerfu strings in"   <cx "lerfu strings, uses in mathematics">  XE "lerfu string: use in mathematics"   This chapter is not about Lojban mathematics, which is explained in <a href=chap18.html>Chapter 18</a>, so the mathematical uses of lerfu strings will be listed and exemplified but not explained.
<p>
<cx "lerfu string, as mathematical variable">  XE "lerfu string: as mathematical variable"   <cx "mathematical variables, lerfu strings as">  XE "mathematical variables: lerfu strings as"   A lerfu string as mathematical variable:

	a = b + c
</pre><cx "lerfu string, as function name">  XE "lerfu string: as function name"   <cx "function name, lerfu string as">  XE "function name: lerfu string as"   A lerfu string as function name (preceded by “ma'o” of selma'o MAhO):

	the-number y equals the number the-function f of x
	y = f(x)
</pre><p>Note the “boi” here to separate the lerfu strings “fy” and “xy”.
<p>
<cx "lerfu string, as selbri">  XE "lerfu string: as selbri"   <cx "selbri, lerfu string as">  XE "selbri: lerfu string as"   A lerfu string as selbri (followed by a cmavo of selma'o MOI):
<p>
<ex "Nth rat">  XE "Nth rat: example“  <pre><a name=e11d3>11.3)	le vi ratcu ny.moi le'i mi ratcu
	the here rat is-nth-of the-set-of my rats
	This rat is my Nth rat.
</pre><cx "lerfu string, as utterance ordinal">  XE "lerfu string: as utterance ordinal"   <cx "utterance ordinal, lerfu string as">  XE "utterance ordinal: lerfu string as"   A lerfu string as utterance ordinal (followed by a cmavo of selma'o MAI):
<p>
<ex "Nthly">  XE "Nthly: example“  <pre><a name=e11d4>11.4)	ny.mai
	Nthly
</pre><cx "lerfu string, as subscript">  XE "lerfu string: as subscript"   <cx "subscript, lerfu string as">  XE “subscripts: lerfu string as"   A lerfu string as subscript (preceded by “xi” of selma'o XI):
<p>
<ex "x sub k">  XE "x{k}: x sub k, example“  <pre><a name=e11d5>11.5)	xy. xi ky.
	x sub k
</pre><cx "lerfu string, as quantifier">  XE "lerfu string: as quantifier"   <cx "quantifier, lerfu string as">  XE "quantifier: lerfu string as"   A lerfu string as quantifier (enclosed in “vei <dots>…</dots>ve'o” parentheses):
<p>
<ex "n people">  XE "n people: example“  <lx "vei">  XE "vei"   <pre><a name=e11d6>11.6)	vei ny. [ve'o] lo prenu
	(“n” ) persons
</pre><cx "lerfu strings as quantifiers, avoiding interaction with sumti quantified">  XE "lerfu string: as quantifier, avoiding interaction with sumti quantifier"   The parentheses are required because “ny. lo prenu” would be two separate sumti, “ny.” and “lo prenu”. In general, any mathematical expression other than a simple number must be in parentheses when used as a quantifier; the right parenthesis mark, the cmavo “ve'o”, can usually be elided.
<p>
<cx "lerfu string interpretation, contrasted with mathematical interpretation">  XE "lerfu string: interpretation, contrasted with mathematical interpretation"   <cx "lerfu juxtaposition interpretation, contrasted with mathematical interpretation">  XE "lerfu juxtaposition interpretation: contrasted with mathematical interpretation"   All the examples above have exhibited single lerfu words rather than lerfu strings, in accordance with the conventions of ordinary mathematics. A longer lerfu string would still be treated as a single variable or function name: in Lojban, “.abu by. cy.” is not the multiplication “a ( b ( c” but is the variable “abc”. (Of course, a local convention could be employed that made the value of a variable like “abc”, with a multi-lerfu-word name, equal to the values of the variables “a”, “b”, and “c” multiplied together.)
<p>
<cx "mathematical texts, effect on lerfu shift scope">  XE "mathematical texts: effect on lerfu shift scope"   <cx "lerfu shift scope, exception for mathematical texts">  XE "lerfu shift scope: exception for mathematical texts"   There is a special rule about shift words in mathematical text: shifts within mathematical expressions do not affect lerfu words appearing outside <dl compact><dt>mathematical expressions, and vice versa.	<dd>
</dl><a name=s12><h3>Acronyms</h3>
<p>
<cx "acronym, definition">  XE "acronym: definition"   An acronym is a name constructed of lerfu. English examples are “DNA”, “NATO”, “CIA”. In English, some of these are spelled out (like “DNA” and “CIA”) and others are pronounced more or less as if they were ordinary English words (like “NATO”). Some acronyms fluctuate between the two pronunciations: “SQL” may be “ess cue ell” or “sequel”.
<p>
<cx "acronyms, using names based on lerfu words">  XE "acronyms: using names based on lerfu words"   <cx "lerfu words, as a basis for acronym names">  XE "lerfu words: as a basis for acronym names"   In Lojban, a name can be almost any sequence of sounds that ends in a consonant and is followed by a pause. The easiest way to Lojbanize acronym names is to glue the lerfu words together, using “ ' ”wherever two vowels would come together (pauses are illegal in names) and adding a final consonant:
<p>
<ex "DNA">  XE "DNA: example“  <ex "CIA">  XE "CIA: example“  <ex "IBM">  XE "IBM: example“  <ex "NATO">  XE "NATO: example“  <ex "SQL">  XE "SQL: example“  <ex "NYC">  XE "NYC: example“  <pre><a name=e12d1>12.1)	la dyny'abub.  .i la ny'abuty'obub.
	.i la cy'ibu'abub.  .i la sykybulyl.
	.i la .ibubymym.  .i la ny'ybucyc.
	DNA.  NATO.
	CIA.  SQL.
	IBM.  NYC.
</pre><cx "acronym names from lerfu words, assigning final consonant">  XE "acronym names from lerfu words: assigning final consonant"   There is no fixed convention for assigning the final consonant. In <a href=#e12d1>Example 12.1</a>, the last consonant of the lerfu string has been replicated into final position.
<p>
<cx "acronyms names based on lerfu words, omitting bu">  XE "acronyms names based on lerfu words: omitting bu"   <cx "bu, omitting in acronyms names based on lerfu words">  XE "bu: omitting in acronyms names based on lerfu words"   Some compression can be done by leaving out “bu” after vowel lerfu words (except for “.y.bu”, wherein the “bu” cannot be omitted without ambiguity). Compression is moderately important because it's hard to say long names without introducing an involuntary (and illegal) pause:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d2>12.2)	la dyny'am.  .i la ny'aty'om.
	.i la cy'i'am.  .i la sykybulym.
	.i la .ibymym.  .i la ny'ybucym.
	DNA.  NATO.
	CIA.  SQL.
	IBM.  NYC.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e12d2>Example 12.2</a>, the final consonant “m” stands for “merko”, indicating the source culture of these acronyms.
<p>
<cx "acronyms names based on lerfu words, using “z” instead of “ ' ”in">  XE "acronyms names based on lerfu words: using \“z\” instead of \“ ' \”in"   <cx "“z” instead of “ ' ”, in acronyms names based on lerfu words">  XE "z instead of ' : in acronymic names based on lerfu words"   Another approach, which some may find easier to say and which is compatible with older versions of the language that did not have a “ ' ”character, is to use the consonant “z” instead of “ ' ”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d3>12.3)	la dynyzaz.  .i la nyzatyzoz.
	.i la cyzizaz.  .i la sykybulyz.
	.i la .ibymyz.  .i la nyzybucyz.
	DNA.  NATO.
	CIA.  SQL.
	IBM.  NYC.
</pre><cx "lerfu strings, as acronyms using “me”">  XE "lerfu string: as acronym using \“me\”"   <cx "acronyms, as lerfu strings using “me”">  XE "acronyms: as lerfu strings using \“me\”"   <lx "me">  XE "me"   One more alternative to these lengthy names is to use the lerfu string itself prefixed with “me”, the cmavo that makes sumti into selbri:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d4>12.4)	la me dy ny. .abu
	that-named what-pertains-to “d” “n” “a”
</pre><p>This works because “la”, the cmavo that normally introduces names used as sumti, may also be used before a predicate to indicate that the predicate is a (meaningful) name:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d5>12.5)	la cribe cu ciska
	That-named “Bear” writes.
	Bear is a writer.
</pre><a href=#e12d5>Example 12.5 </a>does not of course refer to a bear (“le cribe” or “lo cribe”) but to something else, probably a person, named “Bear”. Similarly, “me dy ny. .abu” is a predicate which can be used as a name, producing a kind of acronym which can have pauses between the individual lerfu words.

<a name=s13><h3>Computerized character codes</h3>
<p>
<cx "character codes, definition">  XE "character codes: definition"   <cx "characters, definition">  XE "characters: definition"   <cx "lerfu words, using computer encoding schemes with se'e">  XE "lerfu words: using computer encoding schemes with se'e"   <cx "character encoding schemes, application to lerfu words">  XE "character encoding schemes: application to lerfu words"   <cx "letter encoding schemes, application to lerfu words">  XE "letter encoding schemes: application to lerfu words"   <lx "se'e">  XE "se'e"   <lx "BY">  XE "BY selma’o"   Since the first application of computers to non-numerical information, character sets have existed, mapping numbers (called “character codes”) into selected lerfu, digits, and punctuation marks (collectively called “characters”). Historically, these character sets have only covered the English alphabet and a few selected punctuation marks. International efforts have now  created Unicode, a unified character set that can represent essentially all the characters in essentially all the world's writing systems. Lojban can take advantage of these encoding schemes by using the cmavo “se'e” (of selma'o BY). This cmavo is conventionally followed by digit cmavo of selma'o PA representing the character code, and the whole string indicates a single character in some computerized character set:
<p>
<ex "American dollars">  XE "American dollars: example“  <ex "$&dollar;"><pre><a name=e13d1>13.1)	me'o se'ecixa cu lerfu la .asycy'i'is. 
loi merko rupnu
	The-expression [code] 36 is-a-letteral in-set ASCII
		for-the-mass-of American currency-units.
	The character code 36 in ASCII represents American dollars.
	“$&dollar;” represents American dollars.
</pre><cx "ASCII, application to lerfu words">  XE "ASCII: application to lerfu words"   Understanding <a href=#e13d1>Example 13.1 </a>depends on knowing the value in the ASCII character set (one of the simplest and oldest) of the “$&dollar;” character. Therefore, the “se'e” convention is only intelligible to those who know the underlying character set. For precisely specifying a particular character, however, it has the advantages of unambiguity and (relative) cultural neutrality, and therefore Lojban provides a means for those with access to descriptions of such character sets to take advantage of them.
<p>
<cx "Unicode">  XE "Unicode"   <cx "peace symbol">  XE "peace symbol"   As another example, the Unicode character set (also known as ISO 10646) represents the international symbol of peace, an inverted trident in a circle, using the base-16 value 262E. In a suitable context, a Lojbanist may say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d2>13.2)	me'o se'erexarerei sinxa le ka panpi
	The-expression [code] 262E is-a-sign-of the quality-of being-at-peace.
</pre><cx "se'e, and number base convention">  XE "se'e: and number base convention"   When a “se'e” string appears in running discourse, some metalinguistic convention must specify whether the number is base 10 or some other base, and which character set is in use.

<p>
<a name=s15><h3>Proposed lerfu words — introduction</h3>
<p>
<cx "lerfu words, list of proposed, notation convention">  XE "lerfu words: list of proposed, notation convention"   The following sections contain tables of proposed lerfu words for some of the standard alphabets supported by the Lojban lerfu system. The first column of each list is the lerfu (actually, a Latin-alphabet name sufficient to identify it). The second column is the proposed name-based lerfu word, and the third column is the proposed lerfu word in the system based on using the cmavo of selma'o BY with a shift word.
<p>
<cx "proposed lerfu words, as working basis">  XE "proposed lerfu words: as working basis"   These tables are not meant to be authoritative (several authorities within the Lojban community have niggled over them extensively, disagreeing with each other and sometimes with themselves). They provide a working basis until actual usage is available, rather than a final resolution of lerfu word problems. Probably the system presented here will evolve somewhat before settling down into a final, conventional form.

lojbau mekso: Mathematical Expressions in Lojban</h2>
<h6>$Revision: 4.3 $<br>
mkhtml: 1.1</h6></p></center>
<p>
<a name=s1><h3>Introductory</h3>
<cx "mekso, definition">  XE "mekso: definition"   <cx "mathematical expression, abbreviation notation">  XE "mathematical expression: abbreviation notation"   <cx "mathematical expression, definition (see also “mekso”)">  XE "mathematical expression: definition (see also \“mekso\”)"   lojbau mekso (“Lojbanic mathematical-expression”) is the part of the Lojban language that is tailored for expressing statements of a mathematical character, or for adding numerical information to non-mathematical statements. Its formal design goals include:
<p>
<cx "mekso, design goals">  XE "mekso: design goals"   <cx "mekso goal, for mathematical writing">  XE "mekso goal: for mathematical writing"   <dl compact><dt>1)	<dd>representing all the different forms of expression used by mathematicians in their normal modes of writing, so that a reader can unambiguously read off mathematical text as written with minimal effort and expect a listener to understand it;
</dl><cx "mekso goal, expandable">  XE "mekso goal: expandable"   <cx "mekso goal, for common use">  XE "mekso goal: for common use"   <dl compact><dt>2)	<dd>providing a vocabulary of commonly used mathematical terms which can readily be expanded to include newly coined words using the full resources of Lojban;
</dl><cx "mekso goal, unambiguous">  XE "mekso goal: unambiguous"   <dl compact><dt>3)	<dd>permitting the formulation, both in writing and in speech, of unambiguous mathematical text;
</dl><cx "mekso goal, coverage">  XE "mekso goal: coverage"   <cx "mekso goal, precision">  XE "mekso goal: precision"   <dl compact><dt>4)	<dd>encompassing all forms of quantified expression found in natural languages, as well as encouraging greater precision in ordinary language situations than natural languages allow.
</dl><cx "mekso goals, mathematical notation form">  XE "mekso goals: mathematical notation form"   <cx "Polish notation, and mekso goals">  XE "Polish notation: and mekso goals"   <cx "reverse Polish notation, and mekso goals">  XE "reverse Polish notation: and mekso goals"   Goal 1 requires that mekso not be constrained to a single notation such as Polish notation or reverse Polish notation, but make provision for all forms, with the most commonly used forms the most easily used.
<p>
<cx "mekso goals, and non-mathematical expression">  XE "mekso goals: and non-mathematical expression"   Goal 2 requires the provision of several conversion mechanisms, so that the boundary between mekso and full Lojban can be crossed from either side at many points.
<p>
<cx "mekso goals, and ambiguity">  XE "mekso goals: and ambiguity"   <cx "mathematical notation, international uniqueness of">  XE "mathematical notation: international uniqueness of"   Goal 3 is the most subtle. Written mathematical expression is culturally unambiguous, in the sense that mathematicians in all parts of the world understand the same written texts to have the same meanings. However, international mathematical notation does not prescribe unique forms. For example, the expression
<p>
<pre><a name=e1d1>1.1)	<math>3x + 2y</math>
</pre><cx "mathematical notation, and omitted operators">  XE "mathematical notation: and omitted operators"   contains omitted multiplication operators, but there are other possible interpretations for the strings “3x” and “2y” than as mathematical multiplication. Therefore, the Lojban verbal (spoken and written) form of <a href=#e1d1>Example 1.1 </a>must not omit the multiplication operators.
<p>
<cx "mekso chapter, table notation convention">  XE "mekso chapter: table notation convention"   <cx "mekso chapter, completeness">  XE "mekso chapter: completeness"   The remainder of this chapter explains (in as much detail as is currently possible) the mekso system. This chapter is by intention complete as regards mekso components, but only suggestive about uses of those components — as of now, there has been no really comprehensive use made of mekso facilities, and many matters must await the test of usage to be fully clarified.

<p>
<a name=s2><h3>Lojban numbers</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<lx "PA">  XE "PA selma’o"   <pre> 	pa	PA	1		xa	PA	6
	re	PA	2	 	ze	PA	7
	ci	PA	3		bi	PA	8
	vo	PA	4		so	PA	9
	mu	PA	5		no	PA	0
</pre><cx "numbers, expressing simple">  XE "numbers: expressing simple"   <cx "digits, cmavo for">  XE "digits: cmavo for"   <cx "numbers, as compound cmavo">  XE "numbers: as compound cmavo"   <cx "ten, expressing as number">  XE "ten: expressing as number"   <cx "hundred, expressing as number">  XE "hundred: expressing as number"   The simplest kind of mekso are numbers, which are cmavo or compound cmavo. There are cmavo for each of the 10 decimal digits, and numbers greater than 9 are made by stringing together the cmavo. Some examples:
<p>
<ex "123">  XE "123: example“  <pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	pa re ci
	one two three
	123
	one hundred and twenty three
<a name=e2d2>2.2)	pa no
	one zero
	10
	ten
<a name=e2d3>2.3)	pa re ci vo mu xa ze bi so no
	one two three four five six seven eight nine zero
	1234567890
	one billion, two hundred and thirty-four million, five hundred and
sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred and ninety.
</pre><cx "numbers, greater than 9">  XE "numbers: greater than 9"   Therefore, there are no separate cmavo for “ten”, “hundred”, etc.
<p>
<cx "number words, pattern in">  XE "number words: pattern in"   There is a pattern to the digit cmavo (except for “no”, 0) which is worth explaining. The cmavo from 1 to 5 end in the vowels “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, “u” respectively; and the cmavo from 6 to 9 likewise end in the vowels “a”, “e”, “i”, and “o” respectively. None of the digit cmavo begin with the same consonant, to make them easy to tell apart in noisy environments.
<p>
<a name=s3><h3>Signs and numerical punctuation</h3>
<p>
<lx "PA">  XE "PA selma’o"   The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	ma'u	PA	positive sign
	ni'u	PA	negative sign
	pi	PA	decimal point
	fi'u	PA	fraction slash
	ra'e	PA	repeating decimal
	ce'i	PA	percent sign
	ki'o	PA	comma between digits
</pre><cx "signed numbers, expressing">  XE "signed numbers: expressing"   <lx "mau">  XE "mau"   <lx "ni'u">  XE "ni'u"   <cx "positive numbers, explicit expression">  XE "positive numbers: explicit expression"   <cx "negative numbers, expressing">  XE "negative numbers: expressing"   A number can be given an explicit sign by the use of “ma'u” and “ni'u”, which are the positive and negative signs as distinct from the addition, subtraction, and negation operators. For example:
<p>
<ex "-1">  XE "-1: example“  <lx "pa">  XE "pa"   <pre><a name=e3d1>3.1)	ni'u pa
	negative-sign 1
	-1
</pre><cx "signs on numbers, grammar">  XE "signs on numbers: grammar"   Grammatically, the signs are part of the number to which they are attached. It is also possible to use “ma'u” and “ni'u” by themselves as numbers; the meaning of these numbers is explained in <a href=#s8>Section 8</a>.
<p>
<cx "numerical punctuation">  XE "numerical punctuation"   <cx "punctuation, in numbers">  XE "punctuation: in numbers"   <cx "decimal point, as numerical punctuation">  XE "decimal point: as numerical punctuation"   Various numerical punctuation marks are likewise expressed by cmavo, as illustrated in the following examples:
<p>
<ex "3.1415">  XE "3.1415: example“  <lx "pi">  XE "pi"   <pre><a name=e3d2>3.2)	ci pi pa vo pa mu
	three point one four one five
	3.1415
</pre><cx "decimal point, effect of different notations">  XE "decimal point: effect of different notations"   (In some cultures, a comma is used instead of a period in the symbolic version of <a href=#e3d2>Example 3.2</a>; “pi” is still the Lojban representation for the decimal point.)
<p>
<ex "2/7">  XE "2/7: example“  <lx "fi'u">  XE "fi'u"   <pre><a name=e3d3>3.3)	re fi'u ze
	two fraction seven
	2/7
</pre><cx "fractions, expressing with numerical punctuation">  XE "fractions: expressing with numerical punctuation"   <cx "fractions, numerator default">  XE "fractions: numerator default"   <cx "reciprocal, expression of mathematical">  XE "reciprocal: expression of mathematical"   <a href=#e3d3>Example 3.3 </a>is the name of the number two-sevenths; it is not the same as “the result of 2 divided by 7” in Lojban, although numerically these two are equal. If the denominator of the fraction is present but the numerator is not, the numerator is taken to be 1, thus expressing the reciprocal of the following number:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d4>3.4)	fi'u ze
	fraction seven
	1/7
</pre><cx "repeating decimals, expressing with numerical punctuation">  XE "repeating decimals: expressing with numerical punctuation"   <lx "ra'e">  XE "ra'e"   <pre><a name=e3d5>3.5)	pi ci mu ra'e pa vo re bi mu ze
	point three five repeating one four two eight five seven
	<math>.35142857142857<dots>…</dots></math>
</pre><cx "repeating decimals, marking start of repeating portion">  XE "repeating decimals: marking start of repeating portion"   Note that the “ra'e” marks unambiguously where the repeating portion “142857” begins.
<p>
<lx "ce'i">  XE "ce'i"   <cx "percent, as numerical punctuation">  XE "percent: as numerical punctuation"   <pre><a name=e3d6>3.6)	ci mu ce'i
	three five percent
	35%
</pre><cx "commas in numbers, as numerical punctuation">  XE "commas in numbers: as numerical punctuation"   <lx "ki'o">  XE "ki'o"   <pre><a name=e3d7>3.7)	pa ki'o re ci vo ki'o mu xa ze
	one comma two three four comma five six seven
	1,234,567
</pre><cx "commas in numbers, effect of other notation conventions">  XE "commas in numbers: effect of other notation conventions"   (In some cultures, spaces are used in the symbolic representation of <a href=#e3d7>Example 3.7</a>; “ki'o” is still the Lojban representation.)
<p>
<cx "commas in numbers, with elided digits">  XE "commas in numbers: with elided digits"   It is also possible to have less than three digits between successive “ki'o”s, in which case zeros are assumed to have been elided:
<p>
<pre><a name=e3d8>3.8)	pa ki'o re ci ki'o vo
	one comma two three comma four
	1,023,004
</pre><p>In the same way, “ki'o” can be used after “pi” to divide fractions into groups of three:

<p>
<pre><a name=e3d9>3.9)	pi ki'o re re
	point comma two two
	.022
<a name=e3d10>3.10)	pi pa ki'o pa re ki'o pa
	point one comma one two comma one
	.001012001
</pre><a name=s4><h3>Special numbers</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<cx "numbers, special">  XE "numbers: special"   <pre> 	ci'i	PA	infinity
	ka'o	PA	imaginary i, sqrt(-1)
	pai	PA	(, pi (approx <math>3.14159<dots>…</dots></math>)
	te'o	PA	exponential e (approx <math>2.71828<dots>…</dots></math>)
	fi'u	PA	golden ratio, (, phi, (1 + sqrt(5))/2 (approx. <math>1.61803<dots>…</dots></math>)
</pre><cx "fraction, meaning with elided numerator and denominator">The last cmavo is the same as the fraction sign cmavo: a fraction sign with neither numerator nor denominator represents the golden ratio.
<p>
Numbers can have any of these digit, punctuation, and special-number cmavo of Sections 2, 3, and 4 in any combination:
<p>
<ex "infinity">  XE "infinity: example“  <lx "ci'i">  XE "ci'i"   <pre><a name=e4d1>4.1)	ma'u ci'i
	<math>+<font face="Symbol">(&#165;</font><!–infty–></math>
</pre><cx "complex numbers, expressing">  XE "complex numbers: expressing"   <lx "ka'o">  XE "ka'o"   <pre><a name=e4d2>4.2)	ci ka'o re
	<math>3i2 </math>(a complex number equivalent to “<math>3 + 2i</math>”)
</pre><cx "ka'o, as special number compared with as numerical punctuation">  XE "ka'o: as special number compared with as numerical punctuation"   Note that “ka'o” is both a special number (meaning “i”) and a number punctuation mark (separating the real and the imaginary parts of a complex number).
<p>
<ex "transfinite cardinal">  XE "transfinite cardinal: example“  <ex "aleph null">  XE "aleph null: example“  <lx "ci'i">  XE "ci'i"   <pre><a name=e4d3>4.3)	ci'i no
	infinity zero
	<math><font face="Symbol">(&#192;</font><!–aleph–><sub>0</sub></math> (a transfinite cardinal)
</pre><p>The special numbers “pai” and “te'o” are mathematically important, which is why they are given their own cmavo:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d4>4.4)	pai
	pi, (
<a name=e4d5>4.5)	te'o
	e
</pre><cx "numerical punctuation, undefined">  XE "numerical punctuation: undefined"   However, many combinations are as yet undefined:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d6>4.6)	pa pi re pi ci
	1.2.3
<a name=e4d7>4.7)	pa ni'u re
	1 negative-sign 2
</pre><cx "negative sign, contrasted with subtraction operator">  XE "negative sign: contrasted with subtraction operator"   <cx "subtraction operator, contrasted with negative sign">  XE "subtraction operator: contrasted with negative sign"   <a href=#e4d7>Example 4.7 </a>is not “1 minus 2”, which is represented by a different cmavo sequence altogether. It is a single number which has not been assigned a meaning. There are many such numbers which have no well-defined meaning; they may be used for experimental purposes or for future expansion of the Lojban number system.
<p>
It is possible, of course, that some of these “oddities” do have a meaningful use in some restricted area of mathematics. A mathematician appropriating these structures for specialized use needs to consider whether some other branch of mathematics would use the structure differently.
<p>
More information on numbers may be found in <a href=#s8>Sections 8 </a>to <a href=#s12>12</a>.
<p>
<a name=s5><h3>Simple infix expressions and equations</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	du	GOhA	equals
	su'i	VUhU	plus
	vu'u	VUhU	minus
	pi'i	VUhU	times
	te'a	VUhU	raised to the power
	ny.	BY	letter “n”
	vei	VEI	left parenthesis
	ve'o	VEhO	right parenthesis
</pre><cx "mathematical notation, infix">  XE "mathematical notation: infix"   <ex "1 + 1 = 2">  XE "1 + 1 = 2: example“  <lx "su'i">  XE "su'i"   <lx "VUhU">  XE "VUhU selma’o"   Let us begin at the beginning: one plus one equals two. In Lojban, that sentence translates to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	li pa su'i pa du li re
	The-number one plus one equals the-number two.
	<math>1 + 1 = 2</math>
</pre><cx "mathematical equality, expressing">  XE "mathematical equality: expressing"   <cx "du, grammar of">  XE "du: grammar of"   <a href=#e5d1>Example 5.1</a>, a mekso sentence, is a regular Lojban bridi that exploits mekso features. “du” is the predicate meaning “x1 is mathematically equal to x2”. It is a cmavo for conciseness, but it has the same grammatical uses as any brivla. Outside mathematical contexts, “du” means “x1 is identical with x2” or “x1 is the same object as x2”.
<p>
<cx "article, number">  XE "article: number"   <cx "the, for talking about numbers themselves">  XE "the: for talking about numbers themselves"   <lx "li">  XE "li"   <cx "number article, explanation of use">  XE "number article: explanation of use"   <cx "numbers, talking about contrasted with using for quantification">  XE "numbers: talking about contrasted with using for quantification"   <cx "numbers, using for quantification contrasted with talking about">  XE "numbers: using for quantification contrasted with talking about"   The cmavo “li” is the number article. It is required whenever a sentence talks about numbers as numbers, as opposed to using numbers to quantify things. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d2>5.2)	le ci prenu
	the three persons
</pre>requires no “li” article, because the “ci” is being used to specify the number of “prenu”. However, the sentence
<p>
<ex "3 grams">  XE "3 grams: example“  <pre><a name=e5d3>5.3)	levi sfani cu grake li ci
	This fly masses-in-grams the-number three.
	This fly has a mass of 3 grams.
</pre><cx "measurements, expressing">  XE "measurements: expressing"   <cx "units of measurement, expressing">  XE "units of measurement: expressing"   requires “li” because “ci” is being used as a sumti. Note that this is the way in which measurements are stated in Lojban: all the predicates for units of length, mass, temperature, and so on have the measured object as the first place and a number as the second place. Using “li” for “le” in <a href=#e5d2>Example 5.2 </a>would produce
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d4>5.4)	li ci prenu
	The-number 3 is-a-person.
</pre>which is grammatical but nonsensical: numbers are not persons.
<p>
<lx "su'i">  XE "su'i"   <lx "VUhU">  XE "VUhU selma’o"   <cx "mathematical operators">  XE "mathematical operators"   <cx "addition, a mathematical operator">  XE "addition: a mathematical operator"   <cx "positive sign, contrasted with addition operator">  XE "positive sign: contrasted with addition operator"   <cx "addition operator, contrasted with positive sign">  XE "addition operator: contrasted with positive sign"   The cmavo “su'i” belongs to selma'o VUhU, which is composed of mathematical operators, and means “addition”. As mentioned before, it is distinct from “ma'u” which means the positive sign as an indication of a positive number:
<p>
<ex "+1 + -1 = 0">  XE "+1 + -1 = 0: example“  <pre><a name=e5d5>5.5)	li ma'u pa su'i ni'u pa du 
li no
	The-number positive-sign one plus negative-sign one equals 
the-number zero.
	<math>+1 + -1 = 0</math>
</pre><p>Of course, it is legal to have complex mekso on both sides of “du”:
<p>
<cx "du, with complex mekso on both sides">  XE "du: with complex mekso on both sides"   <pre><a name=e5d6>5.6)	li mu su'i pa du li ci su'i ci
	The-number five plus one equals the-number three plus three.
	<math>5 + 1 = 3 + 3</math>
</pre><cx "operators of VUhU, grammar of operands">  XE "operators of VUhU: grammar of operands"   <cx "VUhU operands">  XE "VUhU operands"   <cx "operands, contrasted with general sumti">  XE "operands: contrasted with general sumti"   <cx "general sumti, contrasted with operands">  XE "general sumti: contrasted with operands"   <cx "li, as converter of mekso into sumti">  XE "li: as converter of mekso into sumti"   <cx "conversion of mekso into sumti">  XE "conversion of mekso into sumti"   <cx "conversion into sumti from mekso">  XE "conversion into sumti from mekso"   Why don't we say “li mu su'i li pa” rather than just “li mu su'i pa”? The answer is that VUhU operators connect mekso operands (numbers, in <a href=#e5d6>Example 5.6</a>), not general sumti. “li” is used to make the entire mekso into a sumti, which then plays the roles applicable to other sumti: in <a href=#e5d6>Example 5.6</a>, filling the places of a bridi.
<p>
<cx "calculator mathematics, as default in Lojban">  XE "calculator mathematics: as default in Lojban"   <cx "operator precedence, in Lojban default">  XE "operator precedence: in Lojban default"   <cx "operator left-right grouping, as Lojban default">  XE "operator left-right grouping: as Lojban default"   <cx "precedence, mathematical default">  XE "precedence: mathematical default"   By default, Lojban mathematics is like simple calculator mathematics: there is no notion of “operator precedence”. Consider the following example, where “pi'i” means “times”, the multiplication operator:
<p>
<lx "pi'i">  XE "pi'i"   <pre><a name=e5d7>5.7)	li ci su'i vo pi'i mu du li reci
	The-number three plus four times five equals the-number two-three.
	<math>3 + 4 &times;( 5 = 23</math>
</pre><p>Is the Lojban version of <a href=#e5d7>Example 5.7 </a>true? No! “<math>3 + 4 &times; ( 5</math>” is indeed 23, because the usual conventions of mathematics state that multiplication takes precedence over addition; that is, the multiplication “<math>4&times; ( 5</math>” is done first, giving 20, and only then the addition “<math>3 + 20</math>”. But VUhU operators by default are done left to right, like other Lojban grouping, and so a truthful bridi would be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d8>5.8)	li ci su'i vo pi'i mu du li cimu
	The-number three plus four times five equals the-number three-five.
	<math>3 + 4 &times;( 5 = 35</math>
</pre><cx "default operator precedence, contrasted with mekso goal">  XE "default operator precedence: contrasted with mekso goal"   Here we calculate <math>3 + 4</math> first, giving 7, and then calculate <math>7 &times;(( 5</math> second, leading to the result 35. While possessing the advantage of simplicity, this result violates the design goal of matching the standards of mathematics. What can be done?
<p>
<cx "mathematical notation, and operator precedence">  XE "mathematical notation: and operator precedence"   <cx "operator precedence, and mathematical notation">  XE "operator precedence: and mathematical notation"   <cx "operator precedence, effect of pragmatic convention">  XE "operator precedence: effect of pragmatic convention"   There are three solutions, all of which will probably be used to some degree. The first solution is to ignore the problem. People will say “li ci su'i vo pi'i mu” and mean 23 by it, because the notion that multiplication takes precedence over addition is too deeply ingrained to be eradicated by Lojban parsing, which totally ignores semantics. This convention essentially allows semantics to dominate syntax in this one area.
<p>
<cx "operator precedence, rationale for default left-grouping">  XE "operator precedence: rationale for default left-grouping"   <cx "operator precedence in other languages">  XE "operator precedence in other languages"   (Why not hard-wire the precedences into the grammar, as is done in computer programming languages? Essentially because there are too many operators, known and unknown, with levels of precedence that vary according to usage. The programming language 'C' has 13 levels of precedence, and its list of operators is not even extensible. For Lojban this approach is just not practical. In addition, hard-wired precedence could not be overridden in mathematical systems such as spreadsheets where the conventions are different.)
<p>
<cx "operator precedence, generalized explicit specification">  XE "operator precedence: generalized explicit specification"   The second solution is to use explicit means to specify the precedence of operators. This approach is fully general, but clumsy, and will be explained in <a href=#s20>Section 20</a>.

When an operator is prefixed with the cmavo “bi'e” (of selma'o BIhE), it becomes automatically of higher precedence than other operators not so prefixed. Thus,
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d9>5.9)	li ci su'i vo bi'e pi'i mu du li reci
	The-number three plus our-times-five equals the-number two-three.
	<math>3 + 4 (&times; 5 = 23</math>
</pre>is a truthful Lojban bridi. If more than one operator has a “bi'e” prefix, grouping is from the right; multiple “bi'e” prefixes on a single operator are not allowed.

<p>
<lx "te'a">  XE "te'a"   <lx "ny">  XE "ny"   <ex "(n + 1)(n + 1) = n^2 + 2n + 1">  XE "(n + 1)(n + 1) = n^2 + 2n + 1: example“  <pre><a name=e5d10>5.10)	li vei ny. su'i pa ve'o pi'i vei ny. su'i pa [ve'o] du

</pre><cx "lerfu strings, in mathematical expressions">  XE "lerfu string: in mathematical expressions"   <cx "lerfu strings, interpretation of contrasted with normal mathematical interpretation">  XE "lerfu string: interpretation of contrasted with normal mathematical interpretation"   There are several new usages in <a href=#e5d10>Example 5.10</a>: “te'a” means “raised to the power”, and we also see the use of the lerfu word “ny”, representing the letter “n”. In mekso, letters stand for just what they do in ordinary mathematics: variables. The parser will accept a string of lerfu words (called a “lerfu string”) as the equivalent of a single lerfu word, in agreement with computer-science conventions; “abc” is a single variable, not the equivalent of “<math>a (&times; b (&times; c</math>”. (Of course, a local convention could state that the value of a variable like “<math>abc</math>”, with a multi-lerfu name, was equal to the values of the variables “<math>a</math>”, “<math>b</math>”, and “<math>c</math>” multiplied together.)

Note that “ve'o” (the right parenthesis) is an elidable terminator: the first use of it in <a href=#e5d10>Example 5.10 </a>is required, but the second use (marked by square brackets) could be elided. Additionally, the first “bi'e” (also marked by square brackets) is not necessary to get the proper grouping, but it is included here for symmetry with the other one.

<a name=s6><h3>Forethought operators (Polish notation, functions)</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre>	boi	BOI	numeral/lerfu string terminator
	va'a	VUhU	negation/additive inverse
	pe'o	PEhO	forethought flag
	ku'e	KUhE	forethought terminator
	ma'o	MAhO	convert operand to operator

	py.	BY	letter “p”
	xy.	BY	letter “x”
	zy.	BY	letter “z”
	fy.	BY	letter “f”
</pre><cx "infix mathematical notation, shortcomings of">  XE "infix mathematical notation: shortcomings of"   <cx "mathematical notation, infix shortcomings">  XE "mathematical notation: infix shortcomings"   The infix form explained so far is reasonable for many purposes, but it is limited and rigid. It works smoothly only where all operators have exactly two operands, and where precedences can either be assumed from context or are limited to just two levels, with some help from parentheses.
<p>
<cx "Polish notation, definition">  XE "Polish notation: definition"   <cx "forethought mathematical notation (see also Polish)">  XE "forethought mathematical notation (see also Polish)"   <cx "mathematical notation, forethought (see also Polish)">  XE "mathematical notation: forethought (see also Polish)"   But there are many operators which do not have two operands, or which have a variable number of operands. The preferred form of expression in such cases is the use of “forethought operators”, also known as Polish notation. In this style of writing mathematics, the operator comes first and the operands afterwards:
<p>
<ex "sum of 1, 2, 3">  XE "sum of 1: 2, 3, example“  <pre><a name=e6d1>6.1)	li su'i paboi reboi ci[boi] du li xa
	The-number the-sum-of one two three equals the-number six.
	<math><r>sum</r>(1,2,3) = 6</math>
</pre><cx "Polish notation, separating operands in">  XE "Polish notation: separating operands in"   <cx "Polish notation, and use of boi">  XE "Polish notation: and use of boi"   <lx "boi">  XE "boi"   <cx "boi, in Polish notation">  XE "boi: in Polish notation"   Note that the normally elidable number terminator “boi” is required after “pa” and “re” because otherwise the reading would be “pareci” = 123. It is not required after “ci” but is inserted here in brackets for the sake of symmetry. The only time “boi” is required is, as in <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1</a>, when there are two consecutive numbers or lerfu strings.
<p>
<lx "ku'e">  XE "ku'e"   <cx "Polish notation, end-of-operands indicator">  XE "Polish notation: end-of-operands indicator"   Forethought mekso can use any number of operands, in <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1, </a>three. How do we know how many operands there are in ambiguous circumstances? The usual Lojban solution is employed: an elidable terminator, namely “ku'e”. Here is an example:
<p>
<lx "va'a">  XE "va'a"   <ex "plus negative of">  XE "plus negative of: example“  <pre><a name=e6d2>6.2)	li py. su'i va'a ny. ku'e su'i zy du li xy.
	The-number “p” plus negative-of (“n”) plus “z” equals the-number “x”.
	<math>p + -n + z = x</math>
</pre>where we know that “va'a” is a forethought operator because there is no operand preceding it.
<p>
<cx "va'a, contrasted with vu'u and ni'u">  XE "va'a: contrasted with vu'u and ni'u"   <cx "vu'u, contrasted with va'a and ni'u">  XE "vu'u: contrasted with va'a and ni'u"   <cx "ni'u, contrasted with va'a and vu'u">  XE "ni'u: contrasted with va'a and vu'u"   <cx "negation operator, contrasted with subtraction operator">  XE "negation operator: contrasted with subtraction operator"   <cx "subtraction operator, contrasted with negation operator">  XE "subtraction operator: contrasted with negation operator"   <cx "negation operator, contrasted with negative sign">  XE "negation operator: contrasted with negative sign"   <cx "negative sign, contrasted with negation operator">  XE "negative sign: contrasted with negation operator"   <lx "vu'u">  XE "vu'u"   <lx "ni'u">  XE "ni'u"   ““va'a” is the numerical negation operator, of selma'o VUhU. In contrast, j “vu'u” is not used for numerical negation, but only for subtraction, as it always has two or more operands. Do not confuse “va'a” and “vu'u”, which are operators, with “ni'u”, which is part of a number.
<p>
<cx "Polish notation, operator …ku'e compared with parenthesization">  XE "Polish notation: operator …ku'e compared with parenthesization"   <cx "Polish notation, vei …ve'o contrasted with operator …ku'e">  XE "Polish notation: vei …ve'o contrasted with operator …ku'e"   <cx "vei …ve'o, contrasted with operator …ku'e in Polish notation">  XE "vei …ve'o: contrasted with operator …ku'e in Polish notation"   <cx "operator …ku'e in Polish notation, contrasted with vei …ve'o">  XE "operator …ku'e in Polish notation: contrasted with vei …ve'o"   In <a href=#e6d2>Example 6.2</a>, the operator “va'a” and the terminator “ku'e” serve in effect as parentheses. (The regular parentheses “vei” and “ve'o” are NOT used for this purpose.) If the “ku'e” were omitted, the “su'i zy” would be swallowed up by the “va'a” forethought operator, which would then appear to have two operands, “ny” and “su'i zy.”, where the latter is also a forethought expression.
<p>
<cx "functional notation, standard">  XE "functional notation: standard"   Forethought mekso is also useful for matching standard functional notation. How do we represent “z = f(x)”? The answer is:
<p>
<ex "z = f(x)">  XE "z = f(x): example“  <lx "ma'o">  XE "ma'o"   <pre><a name=e6d3>6.3)	li zy du li ma'o fy.boi xy.
	The-number z equals the-number the-operator f x.
	<math>z = f(x)</math>
</pre><cx "lerfu strings as functions, in mathematics">  XE "lerfu string: as function, in mathematics"   <cx "lerfu strings as variables, in mathematics">  XE "lerfu string: as variable, in mathematics"   Again, no parentheses are used. The construct “ma'o fy.boi” is the equivalent of an operator, and appears in forethought here (although it could also be used as a regular infix operator). In mathematics, letters sometimes mean functions and sometimes mean variables, with only the context to tell which. Lojban chooses to accept the variable interpretation as the default, and uses the special flag “ma'o” to mark a lerfu string as an operator. The cmavo “xy.” and “zy.” are variables, but “fy.” is an operator (a function) because “ma'o” marks it as such. The “boi” is required because otherwise the “xy.” would look like part of the operator name. (The use of “ma'o” can be generalized from lerfu strings to any mekso operand: see <a href=#s21>Section 21</a>.)
<p>
<lx "pe'o">  XE "pe'o"   <cx "Polish notation, explicitly marking as">  XE "Polish notation: explicitly marking as"   When using forethought mekso, the optional marker “pe'o” may be placed in front of the operator. This usage can help avoid confusion by providing clearly marked “pe'o” and “ku'e” pairs to delimit the operand list. <a href=#e6d{1}>Examples 6.1 </a>to <a href=#e6d3>6.3</a>, respectively, with explicit “pe'o” and “ku'e”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d4>6.4)	li pe'o su'i paboi reboi ciboi ku'e du li xa
<a name=e6d5>6.5)	li py. su'i pe'o va'a ny. ku'e su'i zy du li xy.

</pre><cx "Polish notation, operands with infix expressions">  XE "Polish notation: operands with infix expressions"   <cx "infix expressions, in operands being used in Polish notation">  XE "infix expressions: in operands being used in Polish notation"   Note: When using forethought mekso, be sure that the operands really are operands: they cannot contain regular infix expressions unless parenthesized with “vei” and “ve'o”. An earlier version of the complex <a href=#e17d6>Example 17.6 </a>came to grief because I forgot this rule.

<a name=s7><h3>Other useful selbri for mekso bridi</h3>
<p>
<cx "mathematical inequalities, expressing">  XE "mathematical inequalities: expressing"   So far our examples have been isolated mekso (it is legal to have a bare mekso as a sentence in Lojban) and equation bridi involving “du”. What about inequalities such as “<math>x < 5</math>”? The answer is to use a bridi with an appropriate selbri, thus:
<p>
<ex "x < 5">  XE "x < 5: example“  <pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	li xy. mleca li mu
	The-number x is-less-than the-number 5.
</pre><p>Here is a partial list of selbri useful in mathematical bridi:
<p>

	dunli:  x1 is equal/congruent to x2 in/on property/quality/dimension/quantity x3
	mleca:  x1 is less than x2
	zmadu:  x1 is greater than x2
	dubjavme'a:  x1 is less than or equal to x2  [du ja mleca, equal or less]
	dubjavmau:  x1 is greater than or equal to x2  [du ja zmadu, equal or greater]

	na'ujbi:  x1 is approximately equal to x2  [namcu jibni, number-near]
	terci'e:  x1 is a component with function x2 of system x3
</pre><cx "dunli, contrasted with du">  XE "dunli: contrasted with du"   <cx "du, contrasted with dunli">  XE "du: contrasted with dunli"   Note the difference between “dunli” and “du”; “dunli” has a third place that specifies the kind of equality that is meant. “du” refers to actual identity, and can have any number of places:
<p>
<ex "p = x = z">  XE "p = x = z: example“  <pre><a name=e7d2>7.2)	py. du xy.boi zy.
	“p” is-identical-to “x” “z”
	<math>p = x = z</math>
</pre><p>Lojban bridi can have only one predicate, so the “du” is not repeated.
<p>
<cx "falsity of mathematical relation, expressing">  XE "falsity of mathematical relation: expressing"   Any of these selbri may usefully be prefixed with “na”, the contradictory negation cmavo, to indicate that the relation is false:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d3>7.3)	li re su'i re na du li mu
	The-number 2 + 2 is-not equal-to the-number 5.
	<math>2 + 2 ( <font face="Symbol">&#189;</font><!–notequal–>5</math>
</pre><p>As usual in Lojban, negated bridi say what is false, and do not say anything about what might be true.

For example, the cmavo “ro” means “all” or “each”. This number does not have a definite value in the abstract: “li ro” is undefined. But when used to count or quantify something, the parallel between “ro” and “pa” is clearer:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d1>8.1)	mi catlu pa prenu
	I look-at one person
<a name=e8d2>8.2)	mi catlu ro prenu

<p>

</pre><cx "so'e, meaning of">  XE "so'e: meaning of"   The English equivalents are only rough: the cmavo provide space for up to five indefinite numbers between “ro” and “no”, with a built-in ordering. In particular, “so'e” does not mean “most” in the sense of “a majority” or “more than half”.
<p>
<lx "pi">  XE "pi"   <cx "pi, effect on indefinite numbers">  XE "pi: effect on indefinite numbers"   <cx "portion of whole, expressing">  XE "portion of whole: expressing"   <cx "indefinite numbers, effect of pi on">  XE "indefinite numbers: effect of pi on"   <ex "whole of">  XE "whole of: example“  Each of these numbers, plus “ro”, may be prefixed with “pi” (the decimal point) in order to make a fractional form which represents part of a whole rather than some elements of a totality. “piro” therefore means “the whole of”:
<p>
<ex "eat bread">  XE "eat bread: example“  <pre><a name=e8d8>8.8)	mi citka piro lei nanba
	I eat the-whole-of the-mass-of bread
</pre><cx "masses, expressing portions of">  XE "mass: expressing portions of"   Similarly, “piso'a” means “almost the whole of”; and so on down to “piso'u”, “a tiny part of”. These numbers are particularly appropriate with masses, which are usually measured rather than counted, as <a href=#e8d8>Example 8.8 </a>shows.
<p>
<lx "no'o">  XE "no'o"   <cx "typical value, contrasted with mathematical average">  XE "typical value: contrasted with mathematical average"   In addition to these cmavo, there is “no'o”, meaning “the typical value”, and “pino'o”, meaning “the typical portion”: Sometimes “no'o” can be translated “the average value”, but the average in question is not, in general, a mathematical mean, median, or mode; these would be more appropriately represented by operators.
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d9>8.9)	mi catlu no'o prenu

<p>
<cx "da'a, default number for">  XE "da'a: default number for"   If no number follows “da'a”, then “pa” is assumed; “da'a” by itself means “all but one”, or in ordinal contexts “all but the last”:

If there are exactly six superpowers (“rairgugde”, “superlative-states”) in the world, then “ro rairgugde” means the same as “xa rairgugde”. It is often useful, however, to express subjective indefinite values. The cmavo “rau” (enough), “du'e” (too many), and “mo'a” (too few) are then appropriate:
<p>
<ex "enough currency">  XE "enough currency: example“  <pre><a name=e8d17>8.17)	mi ponse rau rupnu

<p>
<cx "indefinite numbers, combined with definite">  XE "indefinite numbers: combined with definite"   <cx "definite numbers, combined with indefinite">  XE "definite numbers: combined with indefinite"   Another possibility is that of combining definite and indefinite numbers into a single number.

</pre><cx "radix, decimal (see also base)">  XE "radix: decimal (see also base)"   In normal contexts, Lojban assumes that all numbers are expressed in the decimal (base 10) system. However, other bases are possible, and may be appropriate in particular circumstances.

<p>
<pre><a name=e10d1>10.1)	li pa no pa no ju'u re du li pa no
	The-number 1010 base 2 equals the-number 10.
</pre><cx "base, assumed">  XE "base: assumed"   <cx "base, changing permanently">  XE "base: changing permanently"   Here, the final “pa no” is assumed to be base 10, as usual; so is the base specification.

<p>
<cx "digits, rationale for having 16">  XE "digits: rationale for having 16"   <cx "hexadecimal system, specifying numbers in (see also base)">  XE "hexadecimal system: specifying numbers in (see also base)"   Lojban has digits for representing bases up to 16, because 16 is a base often used in computer applications. In English, it is customary to use the letters A-F as the base 16 digits equivalent to the numbers ten through fifteen. In Lojban, this ambiguity is avoided:
<p>

</pre><cx "digits beyond 9, word pattern">  XE "digits beyond 9: word pattern"   Note the pattern in the cmavo: the diphthongs “au”, “ei”, “ai” are used twice in the same order. The digits for A to D use consonants different from those used in the decimal digit cmavo; E and F unfortunately overlap 2 and 4 — there was simply not enough available cmavo space to make a full differentiation possible. The cmavo are also in alphabetical order.

For example, times represented in hours, minutes, and seconds have, in effect, three “digits”: the first is base 24, the second and third are base 60. To express such numbers, the compound base separator “pi'e” is used:

	3:22:40
</pre><cx "compound base, expressing digits in">  XE "compound base: expressing digits in"   Each digit sequence separated by instances of “pi'e” is expressed in decimal notation, but the number as a whole is not decimal and can only be added and subtracted by special rules:

</pre><lx "MOI">  XE "MOI selma’o"   <cx "numerical selbri, special">  XE "numerical selbri: special"   Lojban possesses a special category of selbri which are based on mekso. The simplest kind of such selbri are made by suffixing a member of selma'o MOI to a number. There are five members of MOI, each of which serves to create number-based selbri with specific place structures.
<p>
<lx "mei">  XE "mei"   <cx "cardinal selbri, place structure">  XE "cardinal selbri: place structure"   <cx "cardinal selbri, definition">  XE "cardinal selbri: definition"   “The cmavo “mei” creates cardinal selbri. The basic place structure is:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>x1 is a mass formed from the set x2 of <math>n</math> members, one or more of which is/are x3
</dl><cx "set, expressing relation with mass formed from set">  XE "set: expressing relation with mass formed from set"   <cx "set, expressing relation with individuals forming set">  XE "set: expressing relation with individuals forming set"   <cx "individuals, expressing relation with set formed">  XE "individuals: expressing relation with set formed"   <cx "individuals, expressing relation with mass formed">  XE "individuals: expressing relation with mass formed"   <cx "mass, expressing relation with set forming">  XE "mass: expressing relation with set forming"   <cx "mass, expressing relation with individuals forming">  XE "mass: expressing relation with individuals forming"   A cardinal selbri interrelates a set with a given number of members, the mass formed from that set, and the individuals which make the set up. The mass argument is placed first as a matter of convenience, not logical necessity.
<p>
Some examples:
<p>
<ex "three rats">  XE "three rats: example“  <pre><a name=e11d1>11.1)	lei mi ratcu cu cimei

	I who am-an-individual express this-sentence.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e11d2>Example 11.2</a>, “mi” refers to a mass, “the mass consisting of me”. Personal pronouns are vague between masses, sets, and individuals.
<p>
However, when the number expressed before “-mei” is an objective indefinite number of the kind explained in <a href=#s8>Section 8</a>, a slightly different place structure is required:

<p>
<ex "manysome">  XE "manysome: example“  <pre><a name=e11d4>11.4)	le'i ratcu poi zvati le panka cu se so'imei

</pre><p>In <a href=#e11d4>Example 11.4</a>, the conversion cmavo “se” swaps the x1 and the x2 places, so that the new x1 is the set. The x4 set is unspecified, so the implication is that the rats are “many” with respect to some unspecified comparison set.

<p>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	xo	PA	number question
</pre><lx "xo">  XE "xo"   <cx "questions, number">  XE "questions: number"   <cx "number questions">  XE "number questions"   The cmavo “xo”, a member of selma'o PA, is used to ask questions whose answers are numbers. Like most Lojban question words, it fills the blank where the answer should go. (See <a href=chap19.html>Chapter 19 </a>for more on Lojban questions.)
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d1>12.1)	li re su'i re du li xo

</pre><cx "digit questions">  XE "digit questions"   <cx "questions, digit">  XE "questions: digit"   ““xo” can also be combined with other digits to ask questions whose answers are already partly specified. This ability could be very useful in writing tests of elementary arithmetical knowledge:

<a name=s13><h3>Subscripts</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	xi	XI	subscript
</pre><cx “subscripts, external grammar of”>  XE “subscripts: external grammar of"  Subscripting is a general Lojban feature, not used only in mekso; there are many things that can logically be subscripted, and grammatically a subscript is a free modifier, usable almost anywhere. In particular, of course, mekso variables (lerfu strings) can be subscripted:
<p>
  XE “x-sub-3"  <pre><a name=e13d1>13.1)	li xy.boixici du li xy.boixipa su’i xy.boixire
	The-number x-sub-3 equals the-number x-sub-1 plus x-sub-2.

</pre>  XE "xi"     XE "XI selma’o"     XE "subscripts: internal grammar of"   
Subscripts always begin with the flag “xi” (of selma'o XI). “xi” may be followed by a number, a lerfu string, or a general mekso expression in parentheses:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d2>13.2)	xy.boixino

<p>
<cx "subscripts, before main expression">  XE "subscripts: before main expression"   <cx "superscripts">  XE "superscripts"   There is no standard way of handling superscripts (other than those used as exponents) or for subscripts or superscripts that come before the main expression. If necessary, further cmavo could be assigned to selma'o XI for these purposes.
<p>
<cx "subscripts, terminator for">  XE "subscripts: terminator for"   <lx "boi">  XE "boi"   <cx "subscripts, multiple as sub-subscript">  XE "subscripts: multiple as sub-subscript"   <cx "sub-subscripts">  XE "sub-subscripts"   The elidable terminator for a subscript is that for a general number or lerfu string, namely “boi”. By convention, a subscript following another subscript is taken to be a sub-subscript:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d5>13.5)	xy.boi xi by.boi xi vo

<a name=s14><h3>Infix operators revisited</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	tu'o	PA	null operand
	ge'a	VUhU	null operator
	gei	VUhU	exponential notation
</pre><lx "tu'o">  XE "tu'o"   <lx "ge'a">  XE "ge'a"   The infix operators presented so far have always had exactly two operands, and for more or fewer operands forethought notation has been required. However, it is possible to use an operator in infix style even though it has more or fewer than two operands, through the use of a pair of tricks: the null operand “tu'o” and the null operator “ge'a”. The first is suitable when there are too few operands, the second when there are too many. For example, suppose we wanted to express the numerical negation operator “va'a” in infix form. We would use:
<p>
<pre><a name=e14d1>14.1)	li tu'o va'a ny. du li no vu'u ny.
	The-number (null) additive-inverse n equals the-number zero minus n.
	-<math>-n = 0 - n</math>
</pre><cx "tu'o, for infix operations with too few operands">  XE "tu'o: for infix operations with too few operands"   <cx "null operand, for infix operations with too few operands">  XE "null operand: for infix operations with too few operands"   <cx "operands, too few for infix operation">  XE "operands: too few for infix operation"   The “tu'o” fulfills the grammatical requirement for a left operand for the infix use of “va'a”, even though semantically none is needed or wanted.
<p>
<lx "gei">  XE "gei"   <cx "gei, as a binary operator">  XE "gei: as a binary operator"   <cx "scientific notation, with gei">  XE "scientific notation: with gei"   <cx "exponential notation, with gei">  XE "exponential notation: with gei"   Finding a suitable example of “ge'a” requires exhibiting a ternary operator, and ternary operators are not common. The operator “gei”, however, has both a binary and a ternary use. As a binary operator, it provides a terse representation of scientific (also called “exponential”) notation. The first operand of “gei” is the exponent, and the second operand is the mantissa or fraction:

<p>
<ex "3 ( 10^8">  XE "3 ( 10^8: example“  <pre><a name=e14d2>14.2)	li cinonoki'oki'o du

</pre><cx "scientific notation, rationale for order of places">  XE "scientific notation: rationale for order of places"   <cx "gei, rationale for order of places">  XE "gei: rationale for order of places"   Why are the arguments to “gei” in reverse order from the conventional symbolic notation? So that “gei” can be used in forethought to allow easy specification of a large (or small) imprecise number:
<p>
<ex "10^20">  XE "10^20: example“  <pre><a name=e14d3>14.3)	gei reno

The third operand of “gei”, therefore, is the base, with 10 as the default value. Most computers internally store so-called “floating-point” numbers using 2 as the exponent base. (This has nothing to do with the fact that computers also represent all integers in base 2; the IBM 360 series used an exponent base of 16 for floating point, although each component of the number was expressed in base 2.)  Here is a computer floating-point number with a value of 40:

The components must be simple operands rather than full expressions (unless parenthesized). A vector can have any number of components; “te'u” is the elidable terminator. An example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e15d1>15.1)	li jo'i paboi reboi te'u su'i jo'i ciboi voboi du
		li jo'i voboi xaboi

The first combines vectors representing rows of the matrix, and the second combines vectors representing columns of the matrix. Both of them allow any number of arguments: additional arguments are tacked on with the null operator “ge'a”.

It is usually necessary to parenthesize matrices when used with operators in order to avoid incorrect groupings. There are no VUhU operators for the matrix operators of inner or outer products, but appropriate operators can be created using a suitable symbolic lerfu word or string prefixed by “ma'o”.

When subscripted, there is no difference between “pi'a” and “sa'i”.
<p>
<a name=s16><h3>Reverse Polish notation</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> fu'a	FUhA	reverse Polish flag
</pre><cx "RP, as abbreviation for reverse Polish notation">  XE "RP (see reverse Polish notation)"   So far, the Lojban notational conventions have mapped fairly familiar kinds of mathematical discourse. The use of forethought operators may have seemed odd when applied to “+”, but when applied to “f” they appear as the usual functional notation. Now comes a sharp break. Reverse Polish (RP) notation represents something completely different; even mathematicians don't use it much. (The only common uses of RP, in fact, are in some kinds of calculators and in the implementation of some programming languages.)
<p>
<cx "reverse Polish notation, definition">  XE "reverse Polish notation: definition"   <cx "reverse Polish notation, use of parentheses in">  XE "reverse Polish notation: use of parentheses in"   <cx "reverse Polish notation, marker">  XE "reverse Polish notation: marker"   <cx "reverse Polish notation, terminator">  XE "reverse Polish notation: terminator"   <lx "fu'a">  XE "fu'a"   In RP notation, the operator follows the operands. (Polish notation, where the operator precedes its operands, is another name for forethought mekso of the kind explained in <a href=#s6>Section 6</a>.) The number of operands per operator is always fixed. No parentheses are required or permitted. In Lojban, RP notation is always explicitly marked by a “fu'a” at the beginning of the expression; there is no terminator. Here is a simple example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e16d1>16.1)	li fu'a reboi ci su'i du li mu
	the-number (RP!) two, three, plus equals the-number five.
</pre><p>The operands are “re” and “ci”; the operator is “su'i”.

<p>
Here is a more complex example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e16d2>16.2)	li fu'a reboi ci pi'i voboi mu pi'i su'i du
		li rexa
	the-number (RP!) (two, three, times), (four, five, times), plus equals		the-number two-six
</pre><p>Here the operands of the first “pi'i” are “re” and “ci”; the operands of the second “pi'i” are “vo” and “mu” (with “boi” inserted where needed), and the operands of the “su'i” are “reboi ci pi'i”, or 6, and “voboi mu pi'i”, or 20. As you can see, it is easy to get lost in the world of reverse Polish notation; on the other hand, it is especially easy for a mechanical listener (who has a deep mental stack and doesn't get lost) to comprehend.
<p>
<cx "reverse Polish notation, operands of">  XE "reverse Polish notation: operands of"   <cx "reverse Polish notation, parentheses in operands of">  XE "reverse Polish notation: parentheses in operands of"   The operands of an RP operator can be any legal mekso operand, including parenthesized mekso that can contain any valid syntax, whether more RP or something more conventional.
<p>
<cx "reverse Polish notation, number of operands">  XE "reverse Polish notation: number of operands"   <lx "tu'o">  XE "tu'o"   <lx "ge'a">  XE "ge'a"   <cx "reverse Polish notation, with too few operands">  XE "reverse Polish notation: with too few operands"   <cx "reverse Polish notation, with too many operands">  XE "reverse Polish notation: with too many operands"   <lx "tu'o va'a">  XE "tu'o va'a"   <lx "ge'a gei">  XE "ge'a gei"   In Lojban, RP operators are always parsed with exactly two operands. What about operators which require only one operand, or more than two operands? The null operand “tu'o” and the null operator “ge'a” provide a simple solution. A one-operand operator like “va'a” always appears in a reverse Polish context as “tu'o va'a”. The “tu'o” provides the second operand, which is semantically ignored but grammatically necessary. Likewise, the three-operand version of “gei” appears in reverse Polish as “ge'a gei”, where the “ge'a” effectively merges the 2nd and 3rd operands into a single operand. Here are some examples:
<p>
<pre><a name=e16d3>16.3)	li fu'a ciboi muboi vu'u du
		li fu'a reboi tu'o va'a
	The-number (RP!) (three, five, minus) equals

Full details on logical and non-logical connectives are provided in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>. Operands are connected in afterthought with selma'o A and in forethought with selma'o GA, just like sumti. Operators are connected in afterthought with selma'o JA and in forethought with selma'o GUhA, just like tanru components. This parallelism is no accident.

<p>
Despite the large number of rules required to support this feature, it is of relatively minor importance in the mekso scheme of things. <a href=#e17d1>Example 17.1 </a>exhibits afterthought logical connection between operands:

For example:

</pre><p>Omitting the “lo'o” would cause the parser to assume that another operand followed the “.onai” and reject “lo” as an invalid operand.
<p>
Simple examples of logical connection between operators are hard to come by. A contrived example is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e17d4>17.4)	li re su'i je pi'i re du li vo

<pre><a name=e17d7>17.7)	li no ga'o bi'o ke'i pa
	the-number zero (inclusive) from-to (exclusive) one
	<math>[0,1)</math>
	the numbers from zero to one, including zero but not including one
</pre><lx "mi'i">  XE "mi'i"   Intervals defined by a midpoint and range rather than beginning and end points can be expressed by “mi'i”:
<p>
<cx "open interval, expressed with mi'i">  XE "open interval: expressed with mi'i"   <cx "closed interval, expressed with mi'i">  XE "closed interval: expressed with mi'i"   <pre><a name=e17d8>17.8)	li pimu ga'o mi'i ke'i pimu
	the-number 0.5 (plus-or-minus 0.5
</pre>which expresses the same interval as <a href=#e17d7>Example 17.7</a>. Note that the “ga'o” and “ke'i” still refer to the endpoints, although these are now implied rather than expressed. Another way of expressing the same thing:
<p>
<pre><a name=e17d9>17.9)	li pimu su'i ni'upimu bi'o ma'upimu
	the-number 0.5 plus [-0.5 from-to +0.5]
</pre><cx "connection of operands, precedence over operator">  XE "connection of operands: precedence over operator"   Here we have the sum of a number and an interval, which produces another interval centered on the number. As <a href=#e17d9>Example 17.9 </a>shows, non-logical (or logical) connection of operands has higher precedence than any mekso operator.
<p>
<cx "compound subscript">  XE "compound subscript"   <cx "subscript, multiple for same base word">  XE “subscripts: multiple for same base word"   You can also combine two operands with “ce'o”, the sequence connective of selma'o JOI, to make a compound subscript:

<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	na'u	NAhU	selbri to operator
	ni'e	NIhE	selbri to operand
	mo'e	MOhE	sumti to operand
	te'u	TEhU	terminator for all three
</pre><lx "te'u">  XE "te'u"   <cx "na'u, terminator for">  XE "na'u: terminator for"   <cx "ni'e, terminator for">  XE "ni'e: terminator for"   <cx "mo'e, terminator for">  XE "mo'e: terminator for"   One of the mekso design goals requires the ability to make use of Lojban's vocabulary resources within mekso to extend the built-in cmavo for operands and operators. There are three relevant constructs: all three share the elidable terminator “te'u” (which is also used to terminate vectors marked with “jo'i”).
<p>
<lx "na'u">  XE "na'u"   <cx "selbri, converting into an operator">  XE "selbri: converting into an operator"   <cx "operator, converting selbri into">  XE "operator: converting selbri into"   <cx "conversion, selbri into operator">  XE "conversion of selbri into operator"   <cx "selbri place structure, effect on operator formed by">  XE "selbri place structure: effect on operator formed by"   <cx "operator derived from selbri, effect of selbri place structure on">  XE "operator derived from selbri: effect of selbri place structure on"   The cmavo “na'u” makes a selbri into an operator. In general, the first place of the selbri specifies the result of the operator, and the other unfilled places specify the operands:
<p>
<ex "tan(pi/2) = infinity">  XE "tan(pi/2) = infinity: example“  <pre><a name=e18d1>18.1)	li na'u tanjo te'u vei pai fe'i re [ve'o] du li ci'i
	The-number the-operator tangent ( pi( / 2 ) = the-number infinity.
	<math>tan((pi/2) = (<font face="Symbol">&#165;</font><!–infty–></math>
</pre>“tanjo” is the gismu for “x1 is the tangent of x2”, and the “na'u” here makes it into an operator which is then used in forethought.
<p>
<lx "ni'e">  XE "ni'e"   <cx "selbri, converting into an operand">  XE "selbri: converting into an operand"   <cx "operand, converting selbri into">  XE "operand: converting selbri into"   <cx "conversion, selbri into operand">  XE "conversion of selbri into operand"   <cx "formulae, expressing based on pure dimensions">  XE "formulae: expressing based on pure dimensions"   The cmavo “ni'e” makes a selbri into an operand. The x1 place of the selbri generally represents a number, and therefore is often a “ni” abstraction, since “ni” abstractions represent numbers. The “ni'e” makes that number available as a mekso operand. A common application is to make equations relating pure dimensions:
<p>
<ex "Length ( Width ( Depth = Volume">  XE "Length ( Width ( Depth = Volume: example“  <pre><a name=e18d2>18.2)	li ni'e ni clani [te'u] pi'i ni'e ni ganra [te'u] pi'i

This construction is useful in stating equations involving dimensioned numbers:
<p>
<ex "2 rats + 2 rabbits = 4 animals">  XE "2 rats + 2 rabbits = 4 animals: example“  <pre><a name=e18d3>18.3)	li mo'e re ratcu su'i mo'e re ractu du li mo'e vo danlu

	2 rats + 2 rabbits = 4 animals.
</pre><cx "folk quantifiers, expressing">  XE "folk quantifiers: expressing"   <ex "pride of lions">  XE "pride of lions: example“  Another use is in constructing Lojbanic versions of so-called “folk quantifiers”, such as “a pride of lions”:

<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	me'o	LI	the mekso
	nu'a	NUhA	operator to selbri
	mai	MAI	utterance ordinal
	mo'o	MAI	higher order utterance ordinal
	roi	ROI	quantified tense
</pre><p>So far we have seen mekso used as sumti (with “li”), as quantifiers (often parenthesized), and in MOI and ME-MOI selbri. There are a few other minor uses of mekso within Lojban.
<p>
<lx "me'o">  XE "me'o"   <cx "me'o, contrasted with li">  XE "me'o: contrasted with li"   <cx "li, contrasted with me'o">  XE "li: contrasted with me'o"   <cx "mathematical expression, referring to">  XE "mathematical expression: referring to"   The cmavo “me'o” has the same grammatical use as “li” but slightly different semantics. “li” means “the number which is the value of the mekso <dots>…</dots>”, whereas “me'o” just means “the mekso <dots>…</dots>” So it is true that:
<p>
<pre><a name=e19d1>19.1)	li re su'i re du li vo
	The-number two plus two equals the-number four.
	<math>2 + 2 = 4</math>
</pre>but false that:
<p>
<pre><a name=e19d2>19.2)	me'o re su'i re du me'o vo
	The-mekso two plus two equals the-mekso four.
	“2 + 2” = “4”
</pre><cx "li, relation to me'o compared with la/zo relation">  XE "li: relation to me'o compared with la/zo relation"   <cx "me'o, relation to li compared with la/zo relation">  XE "me'o: relation to li compared with la/zo relation"   since the expressions “2 + 2” and “4” are not the same. The relationship between “li” and “me'o” is related to that between “la djan.”, the person named John, and “zo .djan.”, the name “John”.
<p>
<lx "nu'a">  XE "nu'a"   <cx "selbri, converting operator into">  XE "selbri: converting operator into"   <cx "operator, converting into selbri">  XE "operator: converting into selbri"   <cx "conversion, operator into selbri">  XE "conversion of operator into selbri"   <cx "selbri, place structure of converted operator">  XE "selbri: place structure of converted operator"   The cmavo “nu'a” is the inverse of “na'u”, and allows a mekso operator to be used as a normal selbri, with the place structure:
<p>
<dl compact><dt><dd>x1 is the result of applying (operator) to x2, x3, <dots>…</dots>
</dl>for as many places as may be required. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e19d3>19.3)	li ni'umu cu nu'a va'a li ma'umu
	The-number <math>-5 </math>is-the-negation-of the-number <math>+5</math>.

Consider <a href=#e19d4>Example 19.4</a>, to which <a href=#e19d5>Example 19.5 </a>is one correct answer:
<p>
<pre><a name=e19d4>19.4)	li re na'u mo re du li vo
	The-number two what-operator? two equals the-number four
	<math>2 ? 2 = 4</math>
<a name=e19d5>19.5)	nu'a su'i
	plus
</pre><p>In <a href=#e19d4>Example 19.4</a>, “na'u mo” is an operator question, because “mo” is the selbri question cmavo and “na'u” makes the selbri into an operator. <a href=#e19d5>Example 19.5 </a>makes the true answer “su'i” into a selbri (which is a legal utterance) with the inverse cmavo “nu'a”. Mechanically speaking, inserting <a href=#e19d5>Example 19.5 </a>into <a href=#e19d4>Example 19.4 </a>produces:
<p>
<pre><a name=e19d6>19.6)	li re na'u nu'a su'i re du li vo
	The-number two (the-operator the-selbri plus) two equals the-number four.

(Digit strings are compound cmavo beginning with a cmavo of selma'o PA, and containing only cmavo of PA or BY; lerfu strings begin with a cmavo of selma'o BY, and likewise contain only PA or BY cmavo.)

Each “mo'o” subdivision can then be divided into pieces and internally numbered with “mai”. If this chapter were translated into Lojban, each section would be numbered with “mo'o”.

<p>
<a name=s20><h3>Explicit operator precedence</h3>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, Lojban does provide a way for the precedences of operators to be explicitly declared, although current parsers do not understand these declarations.
<p><lx "ti'o">  XE "ti'o"   <lx "SEI">  XE "SEI selma’o"   The declaration is made in the form of a metalinguistic comment using “ti'o”, a member of selma'o SEI. “sei”, the other member of SEI, is used to insert metalinguistic comments on a bridi which give information about the discourse which the bridi comprises. The format of a “ti'o” declaration has not been formally established, but presumably would take the form of mentioning a mekso operator and then giving it either an absolute numerical precedence on some pre-established scale, or else specifying relative precedences between new operators and existing operators.
<p>
<cx "operator precedence, plans for future">  XE "operator precedence: plans for future"   In future, we hope to create an improved machine parser that can understand declarations of the precedences of simple operators belonging to selma'o VUhU. Originally, all operators would have the same precedence. Declarations would have the effect of raising the specified cmavo of VUhU to higher precedence levels. Complex operators formed with “na'u”, “ni'e”, or “ma'o” would remain at the standard low precedence; declarations with respect to them are for future implementation efforts. It is probable that such a parser would have a set of “commonly assumed precedences” built into it (selectable by a special “ti'o” declaration) that would match mathematical intuition: times higher than plus, and so on.
<p>
<a name=s21><h3>Miscellany</h3>
<p>
A few other points:
<p>
<cx "conversion, of operator places">  XE "conversion: of operator places"   <cx "se, use with operators">  XE "se: use with operators"   <lx "se">  XE "se"   “se” can be used to convert an operator as if it were a selbri, so that its arguments are exchanged. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e21d1>21.1)	li ci se vu'u vo du li pa
	The-number three (inverse) minus four equals the-number one.
	3 subtracted from 4 equals 1.
</pre><lx "SE">  XE "SE selma’o"   The other converters of selma'o SE can also be used on operators with more than two operands, and they can be compounded to create (probably unintelligible) operators as needed.
<p>
<lx "NAhE">  XE "NAhE selma’o"   <cx "negation, of operator">  XE "negation: of operator"   Members of selma'o NAhE are also legal on an operator to produce a scalar negation of it. The implication is that some other operator would apply to make the bridi true:
<p>
<pre><a name=e21d2>21.2)	li ci na'e su'i vo du li pare
	The-number 3 non-plus 4 equals the-number 12.
</pre><ex "opposite-of-minus">  XE "opposite-of-minus: example“  <pre><a name=e21d3>21.3)	li ci to'e vu'u re du li mu
	The-number 3 opposite-of-minus 2 equals the-number 5.
</pre><p>The sense in which “plus” is the opposite of “minus” is not a mathematical but rather a linguistic one; negated operators are defined only loosely.
<p>
<lx "la'e">  XE "la'e"   <lx "lu'e">  XE "lu'e"   <cx "referent, of operand">  XE "referent: of operand"   <cx "symbol, for operand">  XE "symbol: for operand"   <lx "bo">  XE "bo"   <cx "negation, of operand">  XE "negation: of operand"   ““la'e” and “lu'e” can be used on operands with the usual semantics to get the referent of or a symbol for an operand. Likewise, a member of selma'o NAhE followed by “bo” serves to scalar-negate an operand, implying that some other operand would make the bridi true:
<p>
<pre><a name=e21d4>21.4)	li re su'i re du li na'ebo mu
	The-number 2 plus 2 equals the-number non-5.
	<math>2 + 2 = </math> something other than 5.
</pre><cx "digits, rafsi for">  XE "digits: rafsi for"   <cx "digits, names from">  XE "digits: names from"   The digits 0-9 have rafsi, and therefore can be used in making lujvo. Additionally, all the rafsi have CVC form and can stand alone or together as names:
<p>
<pre><a name=e21d5>21.5)	la zel. poi gunta la tebes. pu nanmu
	Those-named “Seven” who attack that-named “Thebes” [past] are-men.
	The Seven Against Thebes were men.
</pre><p>Of course, there is no guarantee that the name “zel.” is connected with the number rafsi: an alternative which cannot be misconstrued is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e21d6>21.6)	la zemei poi gunta la tebes. pu nanmu
	Those-named-the Sevensome who attack Thebes [past] are-men.
</pre><cx "PA, members with rafsi">  XE "PA selma’o: members with rafsi"   <cx "rafsi, conventional meaning for frinu">  XE "rafsi: conventional meaning for frinu"   Certain other members of PA also have assigned rafsi: “so'a”, “so'e”, “so'i”, “so'o”, “so'u”, “da'a”, “ro”, “su'e”, “su'o”, “pi”, and “ce'i”. Furthermore, although the cmavo “fi'u” does not have a rafsi as such, it is closely related to the gismu “frinu”, meaning “fraction”; therefore, in a context of numeric rafsi, you can use any of the rafsi for “frinu” to indicate a fraction slash.
<p>
<cx "rafsi, conventional meaning for cu'o">  XE "rafsi: conventional meaning for cu'o"   A similar convention is used for the cmavo “cu'o” of selma'o MOI, which is closely related to “cunso” (probability); use a rafsi for “cunso” in order to create lujvo based on “cu'o”. The cmavo “mei” and “moi” of MOI have their own rafsi, two each in fact: “mem”/“mei” and “mom”/“moi” respectively.

Some flavors of mathematics (lambda calculus, algebra of functions) blur this distinction, and Lojban must have a method of doing the same. An operator can be changed into an operand with “ni'enu'a”, which transforms the operator into a matching selbri and then the selbri into an operand.

In fact, “ma'o” can be followed by any mekso operand, using the elidable terminator “te'u” if necessary.
<p>
<cx "ma'o, potential ambiguity caveat">  XE "ma'o: potential ambiguity caveat"   There is a potential semantic ambiguity in “ma'o fy. [te'u]” if “fy.” is already in use as a variable: it comes to mean “the function whose value is always 'f’”. However, mathematicians do not normally use the same lerfu words or strings as both functions and variables, so this case should not arise in practice.

<a name=s22><h3>Four score and seven: a mekso problem</h3>
<p>
<ex "Gettysburg Address">  XE "Gettysburg Address: example“  <ex "Four score and seven">  XE "Four score and seven: example“  <cx "mekso, and literary translation">  XE "mekso: and literary translation"   Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address begins with the words “Four score and seven years ago”. This section exhibits several different ways of saying the number “four score and seven”. (A “score”, for those not familiar with the term, is 20; it is analogous to a “dozen” for 12.) The trivial way:
<p>
<pre><a name=e22d1>22.1)	bize
	eight seven
	87
</pre><a href=#e22d1>Example 22.1 </a>is mathematically correct, but sacrifices the spirit of the English words, which are intended to be complex and formal.
<p>
<pre><a name=e22d2>22.2)	vo pi'i reno su'i ze
	four times twenty plus seven
	<math>4 &times;( 20 + 7</math>
</pre><cx "score, as 20-year span">  XE "score: as 20-year span"   <a href=#e22d2>Example 22.2 </a>is also mathematically correct, but still misses something. “Score” is not a word for 20 in the same way that “ten” is a word for 10: it contains the implication of 20 objects. The original may be taken as short for “Four score years and seven years ago”. Thinking of a score as a twentysome rather than as 20 leads to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e22d3>22.3)	mo'e voboi renomei su'i ze
	the-number-of four twentysomes plus seven
</pre><p>In <a href=#e22d3>Example 22.3</a>, “voboi renomei” is a sumti signifying four things each of which are groups of twenty; the “mo'e” and “te'u” then make this sumti into a number in order to allow it to be the operand of “su'i”.
<p>
<cx "score, as alternate base for years">  XE "score: as alternate base for years"   <cx "base-20 arithmetic, remnants of">  XE "base-20 arithmetic: remnants of"   Another approach is to think of “score” as setting a representation base. There are remnants of base-20 arithmetic in some languages, notably French, in which 87 is “quatre-vingt-sept”, literally “four-twenties-seven”. (This fact makes the Gettysburg Address hard to translate into French!) If “score” is the representation base, then we have:
<p>
<pre><a name=e22d4>22.4)	vo pi'e ze ju'u reno
	four ; seven base 20
	<math>47<sub>20</sub></math>
</pre><p>Overall, <a href=#e22d3>Example 22.3 </a>probably captures the flavor of the English best. <a href=#e22d1>Example 22.1 </a>and <a href=#e22d2>Example 22.2 </a>are too simple, and <a href=#e22d4>Example 22.4 </a>is too tricky. Nevertheless, all four examples are good Lojban. Pedagogically, these examples illustrate the richness of lojbau mekso: anything that can be said at all, can probably be said in more than one way.

<h2>Chapter 19
<br>
Putting It All Together: Notes on the Structure of Lojban Texts</h2>
<h6>$Revision: 4.1 $<br>
mkhtml: 1.1</h6></p></center>
<p>
Introductory</h3>
<p><cx "text, structure of">  XE "text: structure of"   <a name=s1><h3>
This chapter is incurably miscellaneous. It describes the cmavo that specify the structure of Lojban texts, from the largest scale (paragraphs) to the smallest (single words). There are fewer examples than are found in other chapters of this book, since the linguistic mechanisms described are generally made use of in conversation or else in long documents.
<p>
This chapter is also not very self-contained. It makes passing reference to a great many concepts which are explained in full only in other chapters. The alternative would be a chapter on text structure which was as complex as all the other chapters put together. Lojban is a unified language, and it is not possible to understand any part of it (in full) before understanding every part of it (to some degree).
<p>
Sentences: I</h3>
<p><cx "sentences, joining">  XE "sentences: joining"   <a name=s2><h3>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<lx ".i">  XE "i"   <lx "I">  XE "I selma’o"   <pre>	.i	I	sentence separator
</pre><cx "audio-visually isomorphic">  XE "audio-visually isomorphic"   Since Lojban is audio-visually isomorphic, there needs to be a spoken and written way of signaling the end of a sentence and the start of the following one. In written English, a period serves this purpose; in spoken English, a tone contour (rising or falling) usually does the job, or sometimes a long pause. Lojban uses a single separator: the cmavo “.i” (of selma'o I):
<p>
<pre><a name=e2d1>2.1)	mi klama le zarci  .i do cadzu le bisli
	I go to-the store.  You walk on-the ice.
</pre><cx "sentences, separator for joining">  XE "sentences: separator for joining"   The word “separator” should be noted. “.i” is not normally used after the last sentence nor before the first one, although both positions are technically grammatical. “.i” signals a new sentence on the same topic, not necessarily by the same speaker. The relationship between the sentences is left vague, except in stories, where the relationship usually is temporal, and the following sentence states something that happened after the previous sentence.
<p>
Note that although the first letter of an English sentence is capitalized, the cmavo “.i” is never capitalized. In writing, it is appropriate to place extra space before “.i” to make it stand out better for the reader. In some styles of Lojban writing, every “.i” is placed at the beginning of a line, possibly leaving space at the end of the previous line.
<p>
An “.i” cmavo may or may not be used when the speaker of the following sentence is different from the speaker of the preceding sentence, depending on whether the sentences are felt to be connected or not.
<p>
An “.i” cmavo can be compounded with a logical or non-logical connective (a jek or joik), a modal or tense connective, or both: these constructs are explained in <a href=chap9.html>Chapter 9</a>, <a href=chap10.html>Chapter 10</a>, and <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>. In all cases, the “.i” comes first in the compound. Attitudinals can also be attached to an “.i” if they are meant to apply to the whole sentence: see <a href=chap13.html>Chapter 13</a>.
<p>
<lx "bo">  XE "bo"   <lx "BO">  XE "BO selma’o"   <cx "sentences, close grouping">  XE "sentences: close grouping"   There exist a pair of mechanisms for binding a sequence of sentences closely together. If the “.i” (with or without connectives) is followed by “bo” (of selma'o BO), then the two sentences being separated are understood to be more closely grouped than sentences connected by “.i” alone.
<p>
<lx "tu'e">  XE "tu'e"   <lx "tu'u">  XE "tu'u"   <lx "TUhE">  XE "TUhE selma’o"   <lx "TUhU">  XE "TUhU selma’o"   <cx "title, specifying with tu'e…tu'u">  XE "title: specifying with tu'e…tu'u"   Similarly, a group of sentences can be preceded by “tu'e” (of selma'o TUhE) and followed by “tu'u” (of selma'o TUhU) to fuse them into a single unit. A common use of “tu'e <dots>…</dots>tu'u” is to group the sentences which compose a poem: the title sentence would precede the group, separated from it by “.i”. Another use might be a set of directions, where each numbered direction might be surrounded by “tu'e <dots>…</dots>tu'u” and contain one or more sentences separated by “.i”. Grouping with “tu'e” and “tu'u” is analogous to grouping with “ke” and “ke'e” to establish the scope of logical or non-logical connectives (see <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>).
<p>
Paragraphs: NIhO</h3>
<p><cx "paragraphs, separating">  XE "paragraphs: separating"   <a name=s3><h3>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	ni'o	NIhO	new topic
	no'i	NIhO	old topic
	da'o	DAhO	cancel cmavo assignments
</pre><p>The paragraph is a concept used in writing systems for two purposes: to indicate changes of topic, and to break up the hard-to-read appearance of large blocks of text on the page. The former function is represented in both spoken and written Lojban by the cmavo “ni'o” and “no'i”, both of selma'o NIhO. Of these two, “ni'o” is the more common. By convention, written Lojban is broken into paragraphs just before any “ni'o” or “no'i”, but a very long passage on a single topic might be paragraphed before an “.i”. On the other hand, it is conventional in English to start a new paragraph in dialogue when a new speaker starts, but this convention is not commonly observed in Lojban dialogues. Of course, none of these conventions affect meaning in any way.
<p>
<lx "ni'o">  XE "ni'o"   <lx "NIhO">  XE "NIhO selma’o"   <cx "old topic">  XE "old topic"   <cx "paragraphs, separator">  XE "paragraphs: separator"   A “ni'o” can take the place of an “.i” as a sentence separator, and in addition signals a new topic or paragraph. Grammatically, any number of “ni'o” cmavo can appear consecutively and are equivalent to a single one; semantically, a greater number of “ni'o” cmavo indicates a larger-scale change of topic. This feature allows complexly structured text, with topics, subtopics, and sub-subtopics, to be represented clearly and unambiguously in both spoken and written Lojban. However, some conventional differences do exist between “ni'o” in writing and in conversation.
<p>
<cx "indicator scope">  XE "indicator scope"   <cx "discursive indicator">  XE "discursive indicator"   <lx "da'o">  XE "da'o"   <lx "DAhO">  XE "DAhO selma’o"   <cx "paragraphs, effects on scope">  XE "paragraphs: effects on scope"   <cx "pro-bridi, scope effect of new paragraph">  XE "pro-bridi: scope effect of new paragraph"   <cx "pro-sumti, scope effect of new paragraph">  XE "pro-sumti: scope effect of new paragraph"   <cx "indicators, scope effect of new paragraph">  XE "indicators: scope effect of new paragraph"   <cx "tense, scope effect of new paragraph">  XE "tense: scope effect of new paragraph"   <cx "paragraph separation, written text">  XE "paragraph separation: written text"   In written text, a single “ni'o” is a mere discursive indicator of a new subject, whereas “ni'oni'o” marks a change in the context. In this situation, “ni'oni'o” implicitly cancels the definitions of all pro-sumti of selma'o KOhA as well as pro-bridi of selma'o GOhA. (Explicit cancelling is expressed by the cmavo “da'o” of selma'o DAhO, which has the free grammar of an indicator – it can appear almost anywhere.) The use of “ni'oni'o” does not affect indicators (of selma'o UI) or tense references, but “ni'oni'oni'o”, indicating a drastic change of topic, would serve to reset both indicators and tenses. (See <a href=#s8>Section 8 </a>for a discussion of indicator scope.)
<p>
<cx "Arabian Nights">  XE "Arabian Nights: as multi-level narrative"   <cx "paragraph separation, spoken text">  XE "paragraph separation: spoken text"   In spoken text, which is inherently less structured, these levels are reduced by one, with “ni'o” indicating a change in context sufficient to cancel pro-sumti and pro-bridi assignment. On the other hand, in a book, or in stories within stories such as “The Arabian Nights”, further levels may be expressed by extending the “ni'o” string as needed. Normally, a written text will begin with the number of “ni'o” cmavo needed to signal the largest scale division which the text contains. “ni'o” strings may be subscripted to label each context of discourse: see <a href=#s6>Section 6</a>.
<p>
<cx "previous topic">  XE "previous topic"   <lx "no'i">  XE "no'i"   <lx "NIhO">  XE "NIhO selma’o"   “no'i” is similar in effect to “ni'o”, but indicates the resumption of a previous topic. In speech, it is analogous to (but much shorter than) such English discursive phrases as “But getting back to the point <dots>…</dots>”. By default, the topic resumed is that in effect before the last “ni'o”. When subtopics are nested within topics, then “no'i” would resume the previous subtopic and “no'ino'i” the previous topic. Note that “no'i” also resumes tense and pro-sumti assignments dropped at the previous “ni'o”.
<p>
<cx "subscripted topics">  XE "subscripted topics"   If a “ni'o” is subscripted, then a “no'i” with the same subscript is assumed to be a continuation of it. A “no'i” may also have a negative subscript, which would specify counting backwards a number of paragraphs and resuming the topic found thereby.
<p>
Topic-comment sentences: ZOhU</h3>
<p><cx "topic-comment sentences">  XE "topic-comment sentences"   <a name=s4><h3>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	zo'u	ZOhU	topic/comment separator
</pre><p>The normal Lojban sentence is just a bridi, parallel to the normal English sentence which has a subject and a predicate:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d1>4.1)	mi klama le zarci
	I went to the market.
</pre><cx "topic-comment, description">  XE "topic-comment: description"   In Chinese, the normal sentence form is different: a topic is stated, and a comment about it is made. (Japanese also has the concept of a topic, but indicates it by attaching a suffix; other languages also distinguish topics in various ways.) The topic says what the sentence is about:
<p>
<ex "news">  XE "news: example“  <pre><a name=e4d2>4.2)	zhe<sup>4</sup> xiao<sup>1</sup>xi<sup>2	</sup>wo<sup>3</sup> zhi<sup>1</sup>dao le
	this news	I know [perfective]
	As for this news, I knew it.
	I've heard this news already.
</pre><lx "zo'u">  XE "zo'u"   <lx "ZOhU">  XE "ZOhU selma’o"   The wide space in the first two versions of <a href=#e4d2>Example 4.2 </a>separate the topic (“this news”) from the comment (“I know already”).
<p>
Lojban uses the cmavo “zo'u” (of selma'o ZOhU) to separate topic (a sumti) from comment (a bridi):
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d3>4.3)	le nuzba zu'o mi ba'o djuno
	The news :  I [perfective] know.
</pre><a href=#e4d3>Example 4.3 </a>is the literal Lojban translation of <a href=#e4d2>Example 4.2</a>. Of course, the topic-comment structure can be changed to a straightforward bridi structure:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d4>4.4)	mi ba'o djuno le nuzba
	I [perfective] know the news.
</pre><a href=#e4d4>Example 4.4 </a>means the same as <a href=#e4d3>Example 4.3</a>, and it is simpler. However, often the position of the topic in the place structure of the selbri within the comment is vague:
<p>
<ex "fish eat">  XE "fish eat: example“  <pre><a name=e4d5>4.5)	le finpe zo'u citka
	the fish :  eat
</pre><p>Is the fish eating or being eaten? The sentence doesn't say. The Chinese equivalent of <a href=#e4d5>Example 4.5 </a>is:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d6>4.6)	yu<sup>2	</sup>chi<sup>1</sup>
	fish	eat
</pre>which is vague in exactly the same way.
<p>
Grammatically, it is possible to have more than one sumti before “zo'u”. This is not normally useful in topic-comment sentences, but is necessary in the other use of “zo'u”: to separate a quantifying section from a bridi containing quantified variables. This usage belongs to a discussion of quantifier logic in Lojban (see <a href=chap16.html>Chapter 16</a>), but an example would be:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d7>4.7)	roda poi prenu ku'o su'ode zo'u de patfu da
	For-all X which-are-persons, there-exists-a-Y such-that Y is the father of X.
	Every person has a father.
</pre><p>The string of sumti before “zo'u” (called the “prenex”: see <a href=chap16.html>Chapter 16</a>) may contain both a topic and bound variables:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d8>4.8)	loi patfu roda poi prenu ku'o 
su'ode zo'u de patfu da
	For-the-mass-of fathers for-all X which-are-persons, 
there-exists-a-Y such-that Y is the father of X.
	As for fathers, every person has one.
</pre><cx "topic/comment, multiple sentence">  XE "topic/comment: multiple sentence"   To specify a topic which affects more than one sentence, wrap the sentences in “tu'e <dots>…</dots>tu'u” brackets and place the topic and the “zo'u” directly in front. This is the exception to the rule that a topic attaches directly to a sentence:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d9>4.9)	loi jdini zo'u tu'e do ponse  .inaja do djica [tu'u]
	The-mass-of money :  ( [if] you possess, then you want )
	Money:  if you have it, you want it.
</pre><p>Note: In Lojban, you do not “want money”; you “want to have money” or something of the sort, as the x2 place of “djica” demands an event. As a result, the straightforward rendering of <a href=#e4d8>Example 4.8 </a>without a topic is not:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d10>4.10)	do ponse loi jdini  .inaja do djica ri
	You possess money only-if you desire its-mere-existence.
</pre>where “ri” means “loi jdini” and is interpreted as “the mere existence of money”, but rather:
<p>
<pre><a name=e4d11>4.11)	do ponse loi jdini  .inaja do djica tu'a ri
	You possess money only-if you desire something-about it.
</pre>namely, the possession of money. But topic-comment sentences like <a href=#e4d9>Example 4.9 </a>are inherently vague, and this difference between “ponse” (which expects a physical object in x2) and “djica” is ignored. See <a href=#e9d3>Example 9.3 </a>for another topic/comment sentence.
<p>
The subject of an English sentence is often the topic as well, but in Lojban the sumti in the x1 place is not necessarily the topic, especially if it is the normal (unconverted) x1 for the selbri. Thus Lojban sentences don't necessarily have a “subject” in the English sense.
<p>

</pre><cx "questions, truth">  XE "questions: truth"   <lx "xu">  XE "xu"   <lx "UI">  XE "UI selma’o"   Lojban questions are not at all like English questions. There are two basic types: truth questions, of the form “Is it true that <dots>…</dots>”, and fill-in-the-blank questions. Truth questions are marked by preceding the bridi, or following any part of it specifically questioned, with the cmavo “xu” (of selma'o UI):
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d1>5.1)	xu do klama le zarci
	[True or false?] You go to the store
	Are you going to the store/Did you go to the store?
</pre>(Since the Lojban is tenseless, either colloquial translation might be correct.) Truth questions are further discussed in <a href=chap15.html>Chapter 15</a>.
<p>
<cx "questions, fill-in-the-blank">  XE "questions: fill-in-the-blank"   Fill-in-the-blank questions have a cmavo representing some Lojban word or phrase which is not known to the questioner, and which the answerer is to supply. There are a variety of cmavo belonging to different selma'o which provide different kinds of blanks.
<p>
<lx "ma">  XE "ma"   <lx "KOhA">  XE "KOhA selma’o"   <cx "questions, sumti">  XE "questions: sumti"   Where a sumti is not known, a question may be formed with “ma” (of selma'o KOhA), which is a kind of pro-sumti:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d2>5.2)	ma klama le zarci
	[What sumti?] goes-to the store
	Who is going to the store?
</pre><p>Of course, the “ma” need not be in the x1 place:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d3>5.3)	do klama ma
	You go-to [what sumti?]
	Where are you going?

</pre><p>The answer is a simple sumti:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d4>5.4)	le zarci
	The store.
</pre><p>A sumti, then, is a legal utterance, although it does not by itself constitute a bridi – it does not claim anything, but merely completes the open-ended claim of the previous bridi.
<p>
<cx "questions, multiple">  XE "questions: multiple"   There can be two “ma” cmavo in a single question:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d5>5.5)	ma klama ma
	Who goes where?
</pre>and the answer would be two sumti, which are meant to fill in the two “ma” cmavo in order:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d6>5.6)	mi le zarci
	I, to the store.
</pre><lx "fa'u">  XE "fa'u"   <lx "JOI">  XE "JOI selma’o"   An even more complex example, depending on the non-logical connective “fa'u” (of selma'o JOI), which is like the English “and <dots>…</dots>respectively”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e5d7>5.7)	ma fa'u ma klama ma fa'u ma
	Who and who goes where and where, respectively?
</pre><p>An answer might be
<p>
  XE "Marsha: example"  <pre><a name=e5d8>5.8)	la djan. la marcas. le zarci le briju
	John, Marsha, the store, the office.
	John and Marsha go to the store and the office,
		respectively.
</pre>(Note: A mechanical substitution of <a href=#e5d8>Example 5.8 </a>into <a href=#e5d7>Example 5.7 </a>produces an ungrammatical result, because “* <dots>…</dots>le zarci fa'u le briju” is ungrammatical Lojban: the first “le zarci” has to be closed with its proper terminator “ku”, for reasons explained in <a href=chap14.html>Chapter 14</a>. This effect is not important: Lojban behaves as if all elided terminators have been supplied in both question and answer before inserting the latter into the former. The exchange is grammatical if question and answer are each separately grammatical.)

<lx "mo">  XE "mo"   <lx "GOhA">  XE "GOhA selma’o"   <cx "questions, selbri">  XE "questions: selbri"   Questions to be answered with a selbri are expressed with “mo” of selma'o GOhA, which is a kind of pro-bridi:

	Lojban [what selbri?]
	What is Lojban?
</pre><cx "predicate answers">  XE "predicate answers"   Here the answerer is to supply some predicate which is true of Lojban. Such questions are extremely open-ended, due to the enormous range of possible predicate answers.

Subscripts: XI</h3>
<p><cx "subscripts">  XE "subscripts"   <a name=s6><h3>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	xi	XI	subscript
</pre><lx "xi">  XE "xi"   <lx "XI">  XE "XI selma’o"   <cx "subscripting">  XE "subscripts: marker"   The cmavo “xi” (of selma'o XI) indicates that a subscript (a number, a lerfu string, or a parenthesized mekso) follows. Subscripts can be attached to almost any construction and are placed following the construction (or its terminator word, which is generally required). They are useful either to extend the finite cmavo list to infinite length, or to make more refined distinctions than the standard cmavo list permits. The remainder of this section mentions some places where subscripts might naturally be used.
<p>
Lojban gismu have at most five places:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d1>6.1)	mi cu klama le zarci le zdani le dargu le karce
	I go to-the market from-the house via-the road using-the car.
</pre><p>Consequently, selma'o SE (which operates on a selbri to change the order of its places) and selma'o FA (which provides place number tags for individual sumti) have only enough members to handle up to five places. Conversion of <a href=#e6d1>Example 6.1</a>, using “xe” to swap the x1 and x5 places, would produce:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d2>6.2)	le karce cu xe klama le zarci le zdani le dargu
mi
	The car is-a-transportation-means to-the market from-the house via-the road
for-me.
</pre><p>And reordering of the place structures might produce:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d3>6.3)	fo le dargu fi le zdani fa mi fe le zarci fu le karce cu klama
	Via the road, from the house, I, to the market, using-the car, go.
</pre><a href=#e6d{1}>Examples 6.1 </a>to <a href=#e6d3>6.3 </a>all mean the same thing. But consider the lujvo “nunkla”, formed by applying the abstraction operator “nu” to “klama”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d4>6.4)	la'edi'u cu nunkla
		mi le zarci le zdani le dargu le karce
	The-referent-of-the-previous-sentence is-an-event-of-going
		by-me to-the market from-the house via-the road using-the car.
</pre><cx "subscripting, and sumti re-ordering">  XE “subscripts: and sumti re-ordering"   <cx "SE, after 5th place">  XE "SE selma’o: after 5th place"   <cx "FA, after 5th place">  XE "FA selma’o: after 5th place"   <lx "se">  XE "se"   <lx "SE">  XE "SE selma’o"   <a href=#e6d4>Example 6.4 </a>shows that “nunkla” has six places: the five places of “klama” plus a new one (placed first) for the event itself. Performing transformations similar to that of <a href=#e6d2>Example 6.2 </a>requires an additional conversion cmavo that exchanges the x1 and x6 places. The solution is to use any cmavo of SE with a subscript “6” (see Chapter 19):
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d5>6.5)	le karce cu sexixa nunkla mi
		le zarci le zdani le dargu la'edi'u
	The car is-a-transportation-means-in-the-event-of-going by-me
		to-the market via-the road which-is-referred-to-by-the-last-sentence.
</pre><p>Likewise, a sixth place tag can be created by using any cmavo of FA with a subscript:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d6>6.6)	 fu le dargu fo le zdani fe mi fa la'edi'u
		fi le zarci faxixa le karce cu klama
	Via the road, from the house, by me, the-referent-of-the-last-sentence,
		to the market, using the car, is-an-event-of-going.
</pre><a href=#e6d{4}>Examples 6.4 </a>to <a href=#e6d6>6.6 </a>also all mean the same thing, and each is derived straightforwardly from any of the others, despite the tortured nature of the English glosses. In addition, any other member of SE or FA could be substituted into “sexixa” and “faxixa” without change of meaning: “vexixa” means the same thing as “sexixa”.
<p>
<cx "subscripting, and pro-sumti">  XE “subscripts: and pro-sumti"   <cx "da-series, after third">  XE "da-series: after third"   <cx "ko'a-series, after tenth">  XE "ko'a-series: after tenth"   Lojban provides two groups of pro-sumti, both belonging to selma'o KOhA. The ko'a-series cmavo are used to refer to explicitly specified sumti to which they have been bound using “goi”. The da-series, on the other hand, are existentially or universally quantified variables. (These concepts are explained more fully in <a href=chap16.html>Chapter 16</a>.)  There are ten ko'a-series cmavo and 3 da-series cmavo available.
<p>
<lx "DA">  XE "DA selma’o"   <lx "da">  XE "da"   If more are required, any cmavo of the ko'a-series or the da-series can be subscripted:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d7>6.7)	daxivo
	X sub 4
</pre>is the 4th bound variable of the 1st sequence of the da-series, and
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d8>6.8)	ko'ixipaso
	something-3 sub 18
</pre>is the 18th free variable of the 3rd sequence of the ko'a-series. This convention allows 10 sequences of ko'a-type pro-sumti and 3 sequences of da-type pro-sumti, each with as many members as needed. Note that “daxivo” and “dexivo” are considered to be distinct pro-sumti, unlike the situation with “sexixa” and “vexixa” above. Exactly similar treatment can be given to the bu'a-series of selma'o GOhA and to the gismu pro-bridi “broda”, “brode”, “brodi”, “brodo”, and “brodu”.
<p>
<p>
<cx "subscripting, mathematical">  XE “subscripts: mathematical"   Subscripts on lerfu words are used in the standard mathematical way to extend the number of variables:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d9>6.9)	li xy.boixipa du li xy.boixire su'i xy.boixici
	The-number x-sub-1 equals the-number x-sub-2 plus x-sub-3
	$x<sub>1</sub>  = x<sub>2</sub> + x<sub>3</sub>$
</pre>and can be used to extend the number of pro-sumti as well, since lerfu strings outside mathematical contexts are grammatically and semantically equivalent to pro-sumti of the ko'a-series. (In <a href=#e6d9>Example 6.9</a>, note the required terminator “boi” after each “xy.” cmavo; this terminator allows the subscript to be attached without ambiguity.)
<p>
<p>
<cx "subscripting, and names">  XE “subscripts: and names"   Names, which are similar to pro-sumti, can also be subscripted to distinguish two individuals with the same name:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d10>6.10)	la djan. xipa cusku lu mi'enai do li'u la djan. xire
	John<sub>1</sub> expresses “I-am-not you” to John<sub>2</sub>.
<cx "subscripting, and tense">  XE “subscripts: and tense"   Subscripts on tenses allow talking about more than one time or place that is described by the same general cmavo. For example, “puxipa” could refer to one point in the past, and “puxire” a second point (earlier or later).
<p>
<p>
<cx "subscripting, and fuzzy truths">  XE “subscripts: and fuzzy truths"   You can place a subscript on the word “ja'a”, the bridi affirmative of selma'o NA, to express so-called fuzzy truths. The usual machinery for fuzzy logic (statements whose truth value is not merely “true” or “false”, but is expressed by a number in the range 0 to 1) in Lojban is the abstractor “jei”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d11>6.11)	li pimu jei mi ganra
	The-number .5 is-the-truth-value-of my being-broad
</pre><p>However, by convention we can attach a subscript to “ja'a” to indicate fuzzy truth (or to “na” if we change the amount):
<p>
<pre><a name=e6d12>6.12)	mi ja'a xipimu ganra
	I truly-sub-.5 am-broad
</pre><cx "subscripting, and paragraph separators">  XE “subscripts: and paragraph separators"   Finally, as mentioned in <a href=#s2>Section 2</a>, “ni'o” and “no'i” cmavo with matching subscripts mark the start and the continuation of a given topic respectively. Different topics can be assigned to different subscripts.
<p>
Other uses of subscripts will doubtless be devised in future.
<p>
Utterance ordinals: MAI</h3>
<p><cx "ordinals, utterance">  XE "ordinals: utterance"   <a name=s7><h3>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	mai	MAI	utterance ordinal, -thly
	mo'o	MAI	higher order utterance ordinal
</pre><lx "mai">  XE "mai"   <lx "mo'o">  XE "mo'o"   <lx "MAI">  XE "MAI selma’o"   Numerical free modifiers, corresponding to English “firstly”, “secondly”, and so on, can be created by suffixing “mai” or “mo'o” of selma'o MAI to a number or a lerfu string. Here are some examples:
<p>
<pre><a name=e7d1>7.1)	mi klama pamai le zarci .e remai le zdani
	I go-to (firstly) the store and (secondly) the market.
</pre><p>This does not imply that I go to the store before I go to the market: that meaning requires a tense. The sumti are simply numbered for convenience of reference. Like other free modifiers, the utterance ordinals can be inserted almost anywhere in a sentence without affecting its grammar or its meaning.
<p>
Any of the Lojban numbers can be used with MAI: “romai”, for example, means “all-thly” or “lastly”. Likewise, if you are enumerating a long list and have forgotten which number is wanted next, you can say “ny.mai”, or “Nthly”.
<p>
The difference between “mai” and “mo'o” is that “mo'o” enumerates larger subdivisions of a text; “mai” was designed for lists of numbered items, whereas “mo'o” was intended to subdivide structured works. If this chapter were translated into Lojban, it might number each section with “mo'o”: this section would then be introduced with “zemo'o”, or “<a href=#s7>Section 7</a>.”
<p>
<a name=s8><h3>Attitude scope markers: FUhE/FUhO</h3>
<p>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	fu'e	FUhE	open attitudinal scope
	fu'o	FUhO	close attitudinal scope
</pre><lx "UI">  XE "UI selma’o"   Lojban has a complex system of “attitudinals”, words which indicate the speaker's attitude to what is being said. The attitudinals include indicators of emotion, intensity markers, discursives (which show the structure of discourse), and evidentials (which indicate “how the speaker knows”). Most of these words belong to selma'o UI; the intensity markers belong to selma'o CAI for historical reasons, but the two selma'o are grammatically identical. The individual cmavo of UI and CAI are discussed in <a href=chap13.html>Chapter 13</a>; only the rules for applying them in discourse are presented here.
<p>
<cx "attitudinal, scope">  XE "attitudinal: scope"   Normally, an attitudinal applies to the preceding word only. However, if the preceding word is a structural cmavo which begins or ends a whole construction, then that whole construction is affected by the attitudinal:

<p>
<pre><a name=e8d1>8.1)	mi viska le blanu .ia zdani [ku]
	I see the blue [belief] house.
	I see the house, which I believe to be blue.
<a name=e8d2>8.2)	mi viska le blanu zdani .ia [ku]
	I see the blue house [belief].
	I see the blue thing, which I believe to be a house.
<a name=e8d3>8.3)	mi viska le .ia blanu zdani [ku]
	I see the [belief] blue house.
	I see what I believe to be a blue house.
<a name=e8d4>8.4)	mi viska le blanu zdani ku .ia
	I see (the blue house ) [belief].
	I see what I believe to be a blue house.
</pre><p>An attitudinal meant to cover a whole sentence can be attached to the preceding “.i”, expressed or understood:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d5>8.5)	[.i] .ia mi viska le blanu zdani
	[belief] I see the blue house.
	I believe I see a blue house.
</pre>or to an explicit “vau” placed at the end of a bridi.
<p>
Likewise, an attitudinal meant to cover a whole paragraph can be attached to “ni'o” or “no'i”. An attitudinal at the beginning of a text applies to the whole text.
<p>
<lx "fu'e">  XE "fu'e"   <lx "FUhE">  XE "FUhE selma’o"   <lx "fu'o">  XE "fu'o"   <lx "FUhO">  XE "FUhO selma’o"   However, sometimes it is necessary to be more specific about the range of one or more attitudinals, particularly if the range crosses the boundaries of standard Lojban syntactic constructions. The cmavo “fu'e” (of selma'o FUhE) and “fu'o” (of selma'o FUhO) provide explicit scope markers. Placing “fu'e” in front of an attitudinal disconnects it from what precedes it, and instead says that it applies to all following words until further notice. The notice is given by “fu'o”, which can appear anywhere and cancels all in-force attitudinals. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e8d6>8.6)	mi viska le fu'e .ia blanu zdani fu'o ponse
	I see the [start] [belief] blue house [end] possessor.
	I see the owner of what I believe to be a blue house.
</pre><p>Here, only the “blanu zdani” portion of the three-part tanru “blanu zdani ponse” is marked as a belief of the speaker. Naturally, the attitudinal scope markers do not affect the rules for interpreting multi-part tanru: “blanu zdani” groups first because tanru group from left to right unless overridden with “ke” or “bo”.
<p>
<cx "global attitudinals">  XE "global attitudinals"   Other attitudinals of more local scope can appear after attitudinals marked by FUhE; these attitudinals are added to the globally active attitudinals rather than superseding them.

Quotations: LU, LIhU, LOhU, LEhU</h3>
<p><cx "quotation">  XE "quotation"   <a name=s9><h3>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	lu	LU	begin quotation
	li'u	LIhU	end quotation
	lo'u	LOhU	begin error quotation
	le'u	LEhU	end error quotation
</pre><p>Grammatically, quotations are very simple in Lojban: all of them are sumti, and they all mean something like “the piece of text here quoted”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d1>9.1)	mi pu cusku lu mi'e djan [li'u]
	I [past] express [quote] I-am John [unquote]
	I said, “I'm John”.
</pre><p>But in fact there are four different flavors of quotation in the language, involving six cmavo of six different selma'o. This being the case, quotation deserves some elaboration.
<p>
<cx "opening quotation">  XE "opening quotation"   <lx "lu">  XE "lu"   <lx "LU">  XE "LU selma’o"   <lx "li'u">  XE "li'u"   <lx "LIhU">  XE "LIhU selma’o"   <cx "quotation, of grammatical Lojban text">  XE "quotation: of grammatical Lojban text"   The simplest kind of quotation, exhibited in <a href=#e9d1>Example 9.1</a>, uses the cmavo “lu” (of selma'o LU) as the opening quotation mark, and the cmavo “li'u” (of selma'o LIhU) as the closing quotation mark. The text between “lu” and “li'u” must be a valid, parseable Lojban text. If the quotation is ungrammatical, so is the surrounding expression. The cmavo “li'u” is technically an elidable terminator, but it's almost never possible to elide it except at the end of text.
<p>
<lx "lo'u">  XE "lo'u"   <lx "LOhU">  XE "LOhU selma’o"   <lx "le'u">  XE "le'u"   <lx "LEhU">  XE "LEhU selma’o"   <cx "quotation, of parseable Lojban text">  XE "quotation: of parseable Lojban text"   <cx "quotation, of ungrammatical Lojban text">  XE "quotation: of ungrammatical Lojban text"   The cmavo “lo'u” (of selma'o LOhU) and “le'u” (of selma'o LEhU) are used to surround a quotation that is not necessarily grammatical Lojban. However, the text must consist of morphologically correct Lojban words (as defined in <a href=chap4.html>Chapter 4</a>), so that the “le'u” can be picked out reliably. The words need not be meaningful, but they must be recognizable as cmavo, brivla, or cmene. Quotation with “lo'u” is essential to quoting ungrammatical Lojban for teaching in the language, the equivalent of the * that is used in English to mark such errors:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d2>9.2)	lo'u mi du do du la djan. le'u na tergerna

	[quote] mi du do du la djan. [unquote] is-not a-grammatical-structure 
in Lojban.
</pre><cx "embedded quotation">  XE "embedded quotation"   <a href=#e9d2>Example 9.2 </a>is grammatical even though the embedded quotation is not. Similarly, “lo'u” quotation can quote fragments of a text which themselves do not constitute grammatical utterances:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d3>9.3)	lu le mlatu cu viska le finpe li'u zo'u lo'u viska le le'u
		cu selbasti .ei lo'u viska lo le'u
	[quote] le mlatu cu viska le finpe [unquote] : [quote] viska le [unquote]
is-replaced-by [obligation!] [quote] viska lo [unquote].
	In the sentence “le mlatu viska le finpe”, “viska le” should be replaced by
“viska lo”.
</pre><p>Note the topic-comment formulation (<a href=#s4>Section 4</a>) and the indicator applying to the selbri only (<a href=#s8>Section 8</a>). Neither “viska le” nor “viska lo” is a valid Lojban utterance, and both require “lo'u” quotation.
<p>
<cx "pro-sumti, quotation of">  XE "pro-sumti: quotation of"   <cx "pro-bridi, quotation of">  XE "pro-bridi: quotation of"   Additionally, pro-sumti or pro-bridi in the quoting sentence can refer to words appearing in the quoted sentence when “lu <dots>…</dots>li'u” is used, but not when “lo'u <dots>…</dots>le'u” is used:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d4>9.4)	la tcarlis. cusku lu le ninmu cu morsi li'u
		.iku'i ri jmive
	Charlie says [quote] the woman is-dead [unquote]. 
		However, the-last-mentioned is-alive.
	Charlie says “The woman is dead”, but she is alive.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e9d4>Example 9.4</a>, “ri” is a pro-sumti which refers to the most recent previous sumti, namely “le ninmu”. Compare:
<p>
<pre><a name=e9d5>9.5)	la tcarlis. cusku lo'u le ninmu cu morsi le'u
		.iku'i ri jmive
	Charlie says [quote] le ninmu cu morsi [unquote].

	Charlie says “le ninmu cu morsi”, but he is alive.
</pre><cx "uninterpreted sequence">  XE "uninterpreted sequence"   In <a href=#e9d5>Example 9.5</a>, “ri” cannot refer to the referent of the alleged sumti “le ninmu”, because “le ninmu cu morsi” is a mere uninterpreted sequence of Lojban words. Instead, “ri” ends up referring to the referent of the sumti “la tcarlis.”, and so it is Charlie who is alive.

Since the first “le'u” terminates a “lo'u” quotation, it is not directly possible to have a “lo'u” quotation within another “lo'u” quotation. However, it is possible for a “le'u” to occur within a “lo'u <dots>…</dots>le'u” quotation by preceding it with the cmavo “zo”, discussed in <a href=#s10>Section 10</a>.

The following cmavo are discussed in this section:

<pre> 	zo	ZO	quote single word
	zoi	ZOI	non-Lojban quotation
	la'o	ZOI	non-Lojban name
</pre><cx "strong quotation">  XE "strong quotation"   <lx "zo">  XE "zo"   <lx "ZO">  XE "ZO selma’o"   <cx "quotation, of single word">  XE "quotation: of single word"   The cmavo “zo” (of selma'o ZO) is a strong quotation mark for the single following word, which can be any Lojban word whatsoever. Among other uses, “zo” allows a metalinguistic word to be referenced without having it act on the surrounding text. The word must be a morphologically legal (but not necessarily meaningful) single Lojban word; compound cmavo are not permitted. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d1>10.1)	zo si cu lojbo valsi
	“si” is a Lojbanic word.
</pre><p>Since “zo” acts on a single word only, there is no corresponding terminator. Brevity, then, is a great advantage of “zo”, since the terminators for other kinds of quotation are rarely or never elidable.
<p>
<cx "phoneme stream">  XE "phoneme stream"   <lx "zoi">  XE "zoi"   <lx "ZOI">  XE "ZOI selma’o"   <cx "quotation, of non-Lojban">  XE "quotation: of non-Lojban"   The cmavo “zoi” (of selma'o ZOI) is a quotation mark for quoting non-Lojban text. Its syntax is “zoi X. text .X”, where X is a Lojban word (called the delimiting word) which is separated from the quoted text by pauses, and which is not found in the written text or spoken phoneme stream. It is common, but not required, to use the lerfu word (of selma'o BY) which corresponds to the Lojban name of the language being quoted:
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d2>10.2)	zoi gy. John is a man .gy. cu glico jufra
	“John is a man” is an English sentence.
</pre>where “gy” stands for “glico”. Other popular choices of delimiting words are “.kuot.”, a Lojban name which sounds like the English word “quote”, and the word “zoi” itself. Another possibility is a Lojban word suggesting the topic of the quotation.
<p>
Within written text, the Lojban written word used as a delimiting word may not appear, whereas within spoken text, the sound of the delimiting word may not be uttered. This leads to occasional breakdowns of audio-visual isomorphism: <a href=#e10d3>Example 10.3 </a>is fine in speech but ungrammatical as written, whereas <a href=#e10d4>Example 10.4 </a>is correct when written but ungrammatical in speech.
<p>
<pre><a name=e10d3>10.3)	?mi djuno fi le valsi po'u zoi gy. gyrations .gy.

(CVC and CVV rafsi look like names and cmavo respectively, and so can be quoted using other methods.) For example:

In fact, non-Lojban material in the form of a “zoi” quotation may also appear. However, if the word “le'u” is used either as the delimiting word for the “zoi” quotation, or within the quotation itself, the outer “lo'u” quotation will be prematurely terminated.

The reason for this extra pause is that all Lojban names must be separated by pause from any preceding word other than “la”, “lai”, “la'i” (all of selma'o LA) and “doi” (of selma'o DOI). There are numerous other cmavo that may precede a name: of these, “zo” is one of the most common.)

Internationally known names which can more easily be recognized by spelling rather than pronunciation, such as “Goethe”, can also appear in Lojban text with “la'o”:

Contrastive emphasis: BAhE</h3>
<p><cx "emphasis">  XE "emphasis"   <a name=s11><h3>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	ba'e	BAhE	emphasize next word
	za'e	BAhE	next word is nonce
</pre><p>English often uses strong stress on a word to single it out for contrastive emphasis, thus

</pre>is quite different from
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d2>11.2)	I saw <i>George</i>.
</pre><p>The heavy stress on “<i>George</i>” (represented in writing by <i>italics</i>) indicates that I saw George rather than someone else. Lojban does not use stress in this way: stress is used only to help separate words (because every brivla is stressed on the penultimate syllable) and in names to match other languages' stress patterns. Note that many other languages do not use stress in this way either; typically word order is rearranged, producing something like
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d3>11.3)	It was George whom I saw.
</pre><lx "ba'e">  XE "ba'e"   <lx "BAhE">  XE "BAhE selma’o"   In Lojban, the cmavo “ba'e” (of selma'o BAhE) precedes a single word which is to be emphasized:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d4>11.4)	mi viska la ba'e .djordj.
	I saw the-one-named [emphasis] “George”.
	I saw <i>George</i>.
</pre><p>Note the pause before the name “djordj.”, which serves to separate it unambiguously from the “ba'e”. Alternatively, the “ba'e” can be moved to a position before the “la”, which in effect emphasizes the whole construct “la djordj.”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e11d5>11.5)	mi viska ba'e la djordj.
	I saw [emphasis] the-one-named “George”.
	I saw <i>George</i>.
</pre><cx "emphasis marking">  XE "emphasis marking"   Marking a word with a cmavo of BAhE does not change the word's grammar in any way. Any word in a bridi can receive contrastive emphasis marking:

<p>
<pre><a name=e11d6>11.6)	ba'e mi viska la djordj.
	I, no one else, saw George.
<a name=e11d7>11.7)	mi ba'e viska la djordj.
	I saw (not heard or smelled) George.
</pre><p>Emphasis on one of the structural components of a Lojban bridi can also be achieved by rearranging it into an order that is not the speaker's or writer's usual order. Any sumti moved out of place, or the selbri when moved out of place, is emphatic to some degree.

<p><cx "parenthesis, textual">  XE "parenthesis: textual"   <cx "metalinguistic commentary">  XE "metalinguistic commentary"   <a name=s12><h3>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	to	TO	open parenthesis
	to'i	TO	open editorial parenthesis
	toi	TOI	close parenthesis
	sei	SEI	metalinguistic bridi marker
</pre><lx "to">  XE "to"   <lx "TO">  XE "TO selma’o"   <lx "toi">  XE "toi"   <lx "TOI">  XE "TOI selma’o"   The cmavo “to” and “toi” are discursive (non-mathematical) parentheses, for inserting parenthetical remarks. Any text whatsoever can go within the parentheses, and it is completely invisible to its context. It can, however, refer to the context by the use of pro-sumti and pro-bridi: any that have been assigned in the context are still assigned in the parenthetical remarks, but the reverse is not true.
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d1>12.1)	doi lisas. mi djica le nu to doi frank. ko sisti toi do viska le mlatu
	O Lisa, I desire the event-of (O Frank, [imperative] stop!) you see the cat.
	Lisa, I want you to (Frank! Stop!) see the cat.
</pre><a href=#e12d1>Example 12.1 </a>implicitly redefines “do” within the parentheses: the listener is changed by “doi frank.” When the context sentence resumes, however, the old listener, Lisa, is automatically restored.
<p>
<lx "to'i">  XE "to'i"   <lx "TO">  XE "TO selma’o"   <cx "editorial commentary">  XE "editorial commentary"   There is another cmavo of selma'o TO: “to'i”. The difference between “to” and “to'i” is the difference between parentheses and square brackets in English prose. Remarks within “to <dots>…</dots>toi” cmavo are implicitly by the same speaker, whereas remarks within “to'i <dots>…</dots>toi” are implicitly by someone else, perhaps an editor:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d2>12.2)	la frank. cusku lu mi prami do to'isa'a do du la djein. toi li'u
	Frank expresses “I love you [you = Jane]”

It is required whenever the “to'i <dots>…</dots>toi” remark is physically within quotation marks, at least when speaking to literal-minded listeners; the convention may be relaxed if no actual confusion results.
<p>
Note: The parser believes that parentheses are attached to the previous word or construct, because it treats them as syntactic equivalents of subscripts and other such so-called “free modifiers”. Semantically, however, parenthetical remarks are not necessarily attached either to what precedes them or what follows them.
<p>
<lx "sei">  XE "sei"   <lx "SEI">  XE "SEI selma’o"   <cx "embedded discursive">  XE "embedded discursive"   <cx "discursive, embedded">  XE "discursives: embedded"   <cx "metalinguistic comment, with embedded discursive">  XE "metalinguistic comment: with embedded discursive"   The cmavo “sei” (of selma'o SEI) begins an embedded discursive bridi. Comments added with “sei” are called “metalinguistic”, because they are comments about the discourse itself rather than about the subject matter of the discourse. This sense of the term “metalinguistic” is used throughout this chapter, and is not to be confused with the sense “language for expressing other languages”.
<p>
When marked with “sei”, a metalinguistic utterance can be embedded in another utterance as a discursive. In this way, discursives which do not have cmavo assigned in selma'o UI can be expressed:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d3>12.3)	la frank. prami sei la frank. gleki la djein.
	Frank loves (Frank is happy) Jane.
</pre><p>Using the happiness attitudinal, “.ui”, would imply that the speaker was happy. Instead, the speaker attributes happiness to Frank. It would probably be safe to elide the one who is happy, and say:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d4>12.4)	la frank. prami sei gleki la djein.
	Frank loves (he is happy) Jane.
</pre><p>The grammar of the bridi following “sei” has an unusual limitation: the sumti must either precede the selbri, or must be glued into the selbri with “be” and “bei”:
<p>
  XE "Susan: example"  <pre><a name=e12d5>12.5)	la frank. prami sei gleki be fa la suzn. la djein.
	Frank loves (Susan is happy) Jane.
</pre><p>This restriction allows the terminator cmavo “se'u” to almost always be elided.
<p>
<cx "metalinguistic levels">  XE "metalinguistic levels"   <cx "metalinguistic levels or reference">  XE "metalinguistic levels or reference"   <cx "pro-sumti, and discursive utterances">  XE "pro-sumti: and discursive utterances"   <cx "reference, and discursive utterances">  XE "reference: and discursive utterances"   Since a discursive utterance is working at a “higher” level of abstraction than a non-discursive utterance, a non-discursive utterance cannot refer to a discursive utterance. Specifically, the various back-counting, reciprocal, and reflexive constructs in selma'o KOhA ignore the utterances at “higher” metalinguistic levels in determining their referent. It is possible, and sometimes necessary, to refer to lower metalinguistic levels. For example, the English “he said” in a conversation is metalinguistic. For this purpose, quotations are considered to be at a lower metalinguistic level than the surrounding context (a quoted text cannot refer to the statements of the one who quotes it), whereas parenthetical remarks are considered to be at a higher level than the context.
<p>
Lojban works differently from English in that the “he said” can be marked instead of the quotation. In Lojban, you can say:
<p>
<ex "said John">  XE "said John: example“  <pre><a name=e12d6>12.6)	la djan. cusku lu mi klama le zarci li'u
	John expresses “I go to-the store”.
</pre>which literally claims that John uttered the quoted text. If the central claim is that John made the utterance, as is likely in conversation, this style is the most sensible. However, in written text which quotes a conversation, you don't want the “he said” or “she said” to be considered part of the conversation. If unmarked, it could mess up the anaphora counting. Instead, you can use:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d7>12.7)	lu mi klama le zarci seisa'a la djan. cusku be dei li'u
	“I go to-the store (John expresses this-sentence)”.
	“I go to the store”, said John.
</pre><p>And of course other orders are possible:
<p>
<pre><a name=e12d8>12.8)	lu seisa'a la djan. cusku be dei mi klama le zarci
	John said, “I go to the store”.
<a name=e12d9>12.9)	lu mi klama seisa'a la djan cusku le zarci
	“I go”, John said, “to the store”.
</pre><p>Note the “sa'a” following each “sei”, marking the “sei” and its attached bridi as an editorial insert, not part of the quotation. In a more relaxed style, these “sa'a” cmavo would probably be dropped.
<p>
<lx "se'u">  XE "se'u"   <lx "SEhU">  XE "SEhU selma’o"   The elidable terminator for “sei” is “se'u” (of selma'o SEhU); it is rarely needed, except to separate a selbri within the “sei” comment from an immediately following selbri (or component) outside the comment.
<p>
Erasure: SI, SA, SU</h3>
<p><cx "erasure">  XE "erasure"   <a name=s13><h3>
The following cmavo are discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	si	SI	erase word
	sa	SA	erase phrase
	su	SU	erase discourse
</pre><lx "si">  XE "si"   <lx "SI">  XE "SI selma’o"   <cx "erasure, word">  XE "erasure: word"   The cmavo “si” (of selma'o SI) is a metalinguistic operator that erases the preceding word, as if it had never been spoken:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d1>13.1)	ti gerku si mlatu
	This is-a-dog, er, is-a-cat.
</pre>means the same thing as “ti mlatu”. Multiple “si” cmavo in succession erase the appropriate number of words:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d2>13.2)	ta blanu zdani si si xekri zdani
	That is-a-blue house, er, er, is-a-black house.
</pre><cx "erasure, zo">  XE "erasure: zo"   In order to erase the word “zo”, it is necessary to use three “si” cmavo in a row:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d3>13.3)	zo .bab. se cmene zo si si si la bab.
	The-word “Bob” is-the-name-of the word “si”, er, er, Bob.
</pre><p>The first use of “si” does not erase anything, but completes the “zo” quotation. Two more “si” cmavo are then necessary to erase the first “si” and the “zo”.
<p>
Incorrect names can likewise cause trouble with “si”:
<p>
<cx "erasure, names">  XE "erasure: names"   <pre><a name=e13d4>13.4)	mi tavla fo la .esperanto si si .esperanton.
	I talk in-language that-named “and” “speranto”, er, er, Esperanto.
</pre><p>The Lojbanized spelling “.esperanto” breaks up, as a consequence of the Lojban morphology rules (see <a href=chap4.html>Chapter 4</a>) into two Lojban words, the cmavo “.e” and the undefined fu'ivla “speranto”. Therefore, two “si” cmavo are needed to erase them. Of course, “.e speranto” is not grammatical after “la”, but recognition of “si” is done before grammatical analysis.
<p>
<cx "erasure, quotes">  XE "erasure: quotes"   Even more messy is the result of an incorrect “zoi”:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d5>13.5)	mi cusku zoi fy. gy. .fy. si si si si zo .djan
	I express [foreign] [quote] “gy” [unquote], er, er, er, er, “John”.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e13d5>Example 13.5</a>, the first “fy” is taken to be the delimiting word. The next word must be different from the delimiting word, and “gy.”, the Lojban name for the letter “g”, was chosen arbitrarily. Then the delimiting word must be repeated. For purposes of “si” erasure, the entire quoted text is taken to be a word, so four words have been uttered, and four more “si” cmavo are needed to erase them altogether. Similarly, a stray “lo'u” quotation mark must be erased with “fy. le'u si si si”, by completing the quotation and then erasing it all with three “si” cmavo.
<p>
What if less than the entire “zo” or “zoi” construct is erased? The result is something which has a loose “zo” or “zoi” in it, without its expected sequels, and which is incurably ungrammatical. Thus, to erase just the word quoted by “zo”, it turns out to be necessary to erase the “zo” as well:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d6>13.6)	mi se cmene zo .djan. si si zo .djordj.
	I am-named-by the-word “John”, er, er, the-word “George”.
</pre><p>The parser will reject “zo .djan. si .djordj.”, because in that context “djordj.” is a name (of selma'o CMENE) rather than a quoted word.
<p>
Note: The current machine parser does not implement “si” erasure.
<p>
<cx "starting marker">  XE "starting marker"   <cx "precise erasures">  XE "precise erasures"   <lx "sa">  XE "sa"   <lx "SA">  XE "SA selma’o"   <cx "erasure, multiple word">  XE "erasure: multiple word"   As the above examples plainly show, precise erasures with “si” can be extremely hard to get right. Therefore, the cmavo “sa” (of selma'o SA) is provided for erasing more than one word. The cmavo following “sa” should be the starting marker of some grammatical construct. The effect of the “sa” is to erase back to and including the last starting marker of the same kind. For example:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d7>13.7)	mi viska le sa  .i mi cusku zo .djan.
	I see the <dots>… </dots>I say the-word “John”.
</pre><p>Since the word following “sa” is “.i”, the sentence separator, its effect is to erase the preceding sentence. So <a href=#e13d7>Example 13.7 </a>is equivalent to:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d8>13.8)	mi cusku zo .djan.
</pre><p>Another example, erasing a partial description rather than a partial sentence:
<p>
<pre><a name=e13d9>13.9)	mi viska le blanu zdan. sa le xekri zdani
	I see the blue hou <dots>…</dots>the black house.
</pre><p>In <a href=#e13d9>Example 13.9</a>, “le blanu zdan.” is ungrammatical, but clearly reflects the speaker's original intention to say “le blanu zdani”. However, the “zdani” was cut off before the end and changed into a name. The entire ungrammatical “le” construct is erased and replaced by “le xekri zdani”.

<p>
Note: The current machine parser does not implement “sa” erasure. Getting “sa” right is even more difficult (for a computer) than getting “si” right, as the behavior of “si” is defined in terms of words rather than in terms of grammatical constructs (possibly incorrect ones) and words are conceptually simpler entities. On the other hand, “sa” is generally easier for human beings, because the rules for using it correctly are less finicky.

<cx "multiple speakers">  XE "multiple speakers"   <lx "su">  XE "su"   <lx "SU">  XE "SU selma’o"   <cx "erasure, total">  XE "erasure: total"   The cmavo “su” (of selma'o SU) is yet another metalinguistic operator that erases the entire text. However, if the text involves multiple speakers, then “su” will only erase the remarks made by the one who said it, unless that speaker has said nothing. Therefore “susu” is needed to eradicate a whole discussion in conversation.
<p>
Note: The current machine parser does not implement either “su” or “susu” erasure.

Hesitation: Y</h3>
<p><cx "hesitation">  XE "hesitation"   <a name=s14><h3>
The following cmavo is discussed in this section:
<p>
<pre> 	.y.	Y	hesitation noise
</pre><lx ".y">  XE "y"   <lx "Y">  XE "Y selma’o"   Speakers often need to hesitate to think of what to say next or for some extra-linguistic reason. There are two ways to hesitate in Lojban: to pause between words (that is, to say nothing) or to use the cmavo “.y.” (of selma'o Y). This resembles in sound the English hesitation noise written “uh” (or “er”), but differs from it in the requirement for pauses before and after. Unlike a long pause, it cannot be mistaken for having nothing more to say: it holds the floor for the speaker. Since vowel length is not significant in Lojban, the “y” sound can be dragged out for as long as necessary. Furthermore, the sound can be repeated, provided the required pauses are respected.
<p>
<cx "hesitation sound">  XE "hesitation sound"   Since the hesitation sound in English is outside the formal language, English-speakers may question the need for a formal cmavo. Speakers of other languages, however, often hesitate by saying (or, if necessary, repeating) a word (“este” in some dialects of Spanish, roughly meaning “that is”), and Lojban's audio-visual isomorphism requires a written representation of all meaningful spoken behavior. Of course, “.y.” has no grammatical significance: it can appear anywhere at all in a Lojban sentence except in the middle of a word.

It is outside the regular grammar, and the machine parser takes it as an unconditional signal to stop parsing unless it is quoted with “zo” or with “lo'u <dots>…</dots>le'u”. In particular, it is not used at the end of subordinate texts quoted with “lu <dots>…</dots>li'u” or parenthesized with “to <dots>…</dots>toi”.

Formal Grammars</h2>
<h6>$Revision: 4.0 $</h6>
</p></center>
<p>
<cx "formal grammar">  XE "formal grammar"   <cx "machine grammar">  XE "machine grammar"   The following two listings constitute the formal grammar of Lojban. The first version is written in the YACC language, which is used to describe parsers, and has been used to create a parser for Lojban texts. This parser is available from the Logical Language Group. The second listing is in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) and represents the same grammar in a more human-readable form. (In case of discrepancies, the YACC version is official.) There is a cross-reference listing for each format that shows, for each selma'o and rule, which rules refer to it.

YACC Grammar of Lojban</h3>
<landscape><cx "YACC grammar">  XE "YACC grammar"   <h3>
<p align=center><center>/*Lojban Machine Grammar, Final Baseline
<br>The Lojban Machine Grammar document is explicitly dedicated to the public domain by its author, The Logical Language Group, Inc.<br>
</center></p>
grammar.300 */
<p>
/* The Lojban machine parsing algorithm is a multi-step process. The YACC machine grammar presented here is an amalgam of those steps, concatenated so as to allow YACC to verify the syntactic ambiguity of the grammar. YACC is used to generate a parser for a portion of the grammar, which is LALR1 (the type of grammar that YACC is designed to identify and process successfully), but most of the rest of the grammar must be parsed using some language-coded processing.
<p>
<h4> Step 1 - Lexing</h4>
<p>
From phonemes, stress, and pause, it is possible to resolve Lojban  unambiguously into a stream of words. Any machine processing of speech will have to have some way to deal with 'non-Lojban' failures of fluent speech, of course. The resolved words can be expressed as a text file using Lojban's phonetic spelling rules.
<p>
The following steps assume that there is the possibility of non-Lojban text within the Lojban text (delimited appropriately). Such non-Lojban text may not be reducible from speech phonetically. However, step 2 allows the filtering of a phonetically transcribed text stream, to recognize such portions of non-Lojban text where properly delimited, without interference with the parsing algorithm.
<p>
<p>
<h4> Step 2 - Filtering</h4>
<p>
From start to end, performing the following filtering and lexing tasks using the given order of precedence in case of conflict:
<p>
a. If the Lojban word “zoi” (selma'o ZOI) is identified, take the following Lojban word (which should be end delimited with a pause for separation from the following non-Lojban text) as an opening delimiter.
Treat all text following that delimiter, until that delimiter recurs after a pause, as grammatically a single token (labelled '<a href=#y699>anything_699</a>' in this grammar). There is no need for processing within this text except as necessary to find the closing delimiter.
<p>
b. If the Lojban word “zo” (selma'o ZO) is identified, treat the following Lojban word as a token labelled '<a href=#y698>any_word_698</a>', instead of lexing it by its normal grammatical function.
<p>
c. If the Lojban word “lo'u” (selma'o LOhU) is identified, search for the closing delimiter “le'u” (selma'o LEhU), ignoring any such closing delimiters absorbed by the previous two steps. The text between the delimiters should be treated as the single token '<a href=#y697>any_words_697</a>'.
<p>
d. Categorize all remaining words into their Lojban selma'o category, including the various delimiters mentioned in the previous steps. In all steps after step 2, only the selma'o token type is significant for each word.
<p>
e. If the word “si” (selma'o SI) is identified, erase it and the previous word (or token, if the previous text has been condensed into a single token by one of the above rules).
<p>
f. If the word “sa” (selma'o SA) is identified, erase it and all preceding text as far back as necessary to make what follows attach to what precedes. (This rule is hard to formalize and may receive further definition later.)
<p>
g. If the word 'su' (selma'o SU) is identified, erase it and all preceding text back to and including the first preceding token word which is in one of the selma'o: NIhO, LU, TUhE, and TO. However, if speaker identification is available, a SU shall only erase to the beginning of a speaker's discourse, unless it occurs at the beginning of a speaker's discourse. (Thus, if the speaker has said something, two “su”s are required to erase the entire conversation.
<p>
<p>
<h4> Step 3 - Termination</h4>
<p>
If the text contains a FAhO, treat that as the end-of-text and ignore everything that follows it.
<p>
<p>
<h4> Step 4 - Absorption of Grammar-Free Tokens</h4>
<p>
In a new pass, perform the following absorptions (absorption means that the token is removed from the grammar for processing in following steps, and optionally reinserted, grouped with the absorbing token after parsing is completed).
<p>
a. Token sequences of the form any - (ZEI - any) <dots>…</dots>, where there may be any number of ZEIs, are merged into a single token of selma'o BRIVLA.
<p>
b. Absorb all selma'o BAhE tokens into the following token. If they occur at the end of text, leave them alone (they are errors).
<p>
c. Absorb all selma'o BU tokens into the previous token. Relabel the previous token as selma'o BY.
<p>
d. If selma'o NAI occurs immediately following any of tokens UI or CAI, absorb the NAI into the previous token.
<p>
e. Absorb all members of selma'o DAhO, FUhO, FUhE, UI, Y, and CAI into the previous token. All of these null grammar tokens are permitted following any word of the grammar, without interfering with that word's grammatical function, or causing any effect on the grammatical interpretation of any other token in the text. Indicators at the beginning of text are explicitly handled by the grammar.
<p>
<p>
<h4> Step 5 - Insertion of Lexer Lexemes</h4>
<p>
Lojban is not in itself LALR1. There are words whose grammatical function is determined by following tokens. As a result, parsing of the YACC grammar must take place in two steps. In the first step, certain strings of tokens with defined grammars are identified, and either
<p>
a. are replaced by a single specified 'lexer token' for step 6, or
<p>
b. the lexer token is inserted in front of the token string to identify it uniquely.
<p>
The YACC grammar included herein is written to make YACC generation of a step 6 parser easy regardless of whether a. or b. is used. The strings of tokens to be labelled with lexer tokens are found in rule terminals labelled with numbers between 900 and 1099. These rules are defined with the lexer tokens inserted, with the result that it can be verified that the language is LALR1 under option b. after steps 1 through 4 have been performed. Alternatively, if option a. is to be used, these rules are commented out, and the rule terminals labelled from 800 to 900 refer to the lexer tokens without the strings of defining tokens. Two sets of lexer tokens are defined in the token set so as to be compatible with either option.
<p>
In this step, the strings must be labelled with the appropriate lexer tokens. Order of inserting lexer tokens IS significant, since some shorter strings that would be marked with a lexer token may be found inside longer strings. If the tokens are inserted before or in place of the shorter strings, the longer strings cannot be identified.
<p>
If option a. is chosen, the following order of insertion works correctly (it is not the only possible order): A, C, D, B, U, E, H, I, J, K, M, N, G, O, V, W, F, P, R, T, S, Y, L, Q. This ensures that the longest rules will be processed first; a PA+MAI will not be seen as a PA with a dangling MAI at the end, for example.
<p>
<p>
<h4> Step 6 - YACC Parsing</h4>
<p>
YACC should now be able to parse the Lojban text in accordance with the rule terminals labelled from 1 to 899 under option 5a, or 1 to 1099 under option 5b. Comment out the rules beyond 900 if option 5a is used, and comment out the 700-series of lexer-tokens, while restoring the series of lexer tokens numbered from 900 up.  <p>

/* 'words' may be any Lojban words, with no claim of grammaticality; the preparser will not lex the individual words per their normal selma'o; used to quote ungrammatical Lojban, equivalent to the * or ? writing convention for such text.
The preparser needs one bit of sophistication for this rule. A quoted string should be able to contain other quoted strings - this is only a problem for a LOhU quote itself, since the LEhU clossing this quote would otherwise close the outer quotes, which is incorrect. For this purpose, we will cheat on the use of ZO in such a quote (since this is ungrammatical text, it is a sign ignored by the parser). Use ZO to mark any nested quotation LOhU. The preparser then will absorb it by the ZO rule, before testing for LOhU. This is obviously not the standard usage for ZO, which would otherwise cause the result to be a sumti. But, since the result will be part of an unparsed string anyway, it doesn't matter.
It may be seen that any of the ZO/ZOI/LOhU trio of quotation markers may contain the powerful metalinguistic erasers. Since these quotations are not parsed internally, these operators are ignored within the quote. To erase a ZO, then, two SI's are needed after giving a quoted word of any type. ZOI takes four SI's, with the ENTIRE BODY OF THE QUOTE treated as a single 'word' since it is one selma'o. Thus one for the quote body, two for the single word delimiters, and one for the ZOI. In LOhU, the entire body is treated as a single word, so three SI's can erase it.*/

/* The following are “Lexer-only rules”, covered by steps 1-4  described at the beginning. The grammar of these constructs is nonexistent, except possibly in cases where they interact with each other. Even there, however, the effects are semantic rather than grammatical. Where it is believed possible that conflicts could exist, the grammar of these constructs has been put in the above grammar, even though the lexer/Preparser will actually prevent these from being passed thru to the parse routine. (Otherwise we have to put unacceptably fancy code in the PreParser to determine just when these can be passed thru, and when they can't.)
Constructs in this category include quotes and indicators as defined above. (The above grammar handles utterance scope (free_modifier) and clause scope (gap) applications of the latter, however, and indicators should be allowed to be absorbed into almost any word without changing its grammar.

EBNF Grammar of Lojban
<cx "EBNF grammar">  XE "EBNF grammar"   <h3></h3>Lojban Machine Grammar, EBNF Version, Final Baseline
<p>
This EBNF document is explicitly dedicated to the public domain by its author, The Logical Language Group, Inc.
<p>
Explanation of notation: All rules have the form: 
<p align=center><center>
name<sub>number</sub>= bnf-expression
</center></p>which means that the grammatical construct “name” is defined by “bnf-expression”. The number cross-references this grammar with the rule numbers in the YACC grammar. The names are the same as those in the YACC grammar, except that subrules are labeled with A, B, C,<dots>… </dots>in the YACC grammar and with 1, 2, 3,<dots>… </dots>in this grammar. In addition, rule 971 is “simple_tag” in the YACC grammar but “stag” in this grammar, because of its frequent appearance. <ol>
<li>Names in lower case are grammatical constructs. 
<li>Names in UPPER CASE are selma'o (lexeme) names, and are terminals. 
<li>Concatenation is expressed by juxtaposition with no operator symbol. 
<li>| represents alternation (choice). 
<li>[] represents an optional element. 
<li>& represents and/or (“A & B” is the same as “A   | B   | A B”). 
<li><dots>… </dots>represents optional repetition of the construct to the left.
Left-grouping is implied; right-grouping is shown by explicit
self-referential recursion with no “<dots>… </dots>”
<li>() serves to indicate the grouping of the other operators.
Otherwise, “<dots>… </dots>” binds closer than &, which binds closer than |. 
<li># is shorthand for “[free<dots>…</dots>]”, a construct which appears in many places. 
<li>// encloses an elidable terminator, which may be omitted (without change
of meaning) if no grammatical ambiguity results.
</ol>
